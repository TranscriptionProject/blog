&lt;h1 id="change-the-system-not-yourself">Change the system, not yourself&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a common mistake people made when following popular note taking or productivity systems, be it PARA, Zettelkasten, GTD, Bullet Journals, or anything else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They assume each system is universal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those systems weren&amp;rsquo;t built for mass consumption. Rather, their inventors had each felt a gap in their &lt;em>own&lt;/em> abilities, where their previous systems didn&amp;rsquo;t match their personalities. Like two jigsaw pieces that don&amp;rsquo;t quite fit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Software Engineers like Woodworking</title><link>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/blog/why-software-engineers-like-woodworking/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 02:44:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/blog/why-software-engineers-like-woodworking/</guid><description>&lt;p>The smell of fresh pine sawdust filled the air, with more floating up as I sanded the last rough corner of the stool.

&lt;p>Woodworking was a new hobby I&amp;rsquo;d picked up. My old ones, coding, reading, writing, had kept me stuck to my laptop, holed up by myself. Not very toddler friendly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A surprise &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Decker-Junior-Workbench-Workshop-Realistic/dp/B0016DE80I">gift&lt;/a> laid the seeds of an idea. As a boy, the best summer days were when my dad and I would transform scratch wood into bird houses, planes, and eventually even rube goldberg devices.

R is great for crunching large data sets, and a popular place for people to store their data is on BigQuery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most popular library for accessing BigQuery in R is the open source library &lt;a href="https://github.com/r-dbi/bigrquery">BigRQuery&lt;/a>. It’s an extremely useful library, but it has the downside that the authentication step will try one of two things:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Five Tactics for Tackling Complex Problems at Work</title><link>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/blog/five-tactics-for-tackling-complex-problems/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Nov 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/blog/five-tactics-for-tackling-complex-problems/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“The definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple.” –Albert Einstein&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In today’s world the most valuable employees are the ones who can tackle complex problems. And the best of those are the ones who can make the complex problems look simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But how can someone actually do that? Below are some tactics I’ve used which can make a big difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These tactics are designed to get me thinking about the problem space in different ways. The different perspectives often yield insights that help separate the core components into smaller, more manageable units (and of course this list is always a work in progress)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5 Habits for Better Learning</title><link>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/blog/five-habits-for-better-learning/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2018 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/blog/five-habits-for-better-learning/</guid><description>&lt;p>These mental habits were developed to teach school children how to think critically and become problems solvers. It’s a valuable skill for adults to learn as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When presented with any new information think about:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;strong>Evidence&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>: Why do you think this information is true or false? What should count? What do you think you know and why?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;strong>Viewpoints&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>: How would this look from other perspectives? How would other people or companies think about this differently?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;strong>Connections&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>: Noticing any patterns? Have you seen something like this before?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;strong>Conjecture&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>: What if something about this was different? How would that impact things?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;strong>Relevance&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>: Why does this matter?&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This post will describe how to deploy a statically generated site using yeoman angular to Azure Web Apps, but these steps can be applied to deploy any statically generated site to Azure Web Apps.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Azure Web Apps provides powerful &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-backup/">backup/restore functionality&lt;/a>. (Because disasters can &lt;a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/international-backup-awareness-day/">happen to anyone&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, sometimes you don’t want to backup everything on your site, especially if you backup your site regularly, or if your site has over 10GB of content (that’s the max amount you can backup at a time).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, you probably don’t want to back up the log files. Or if you &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-backup/#configure-automated-backups">setup weekly backups&lt;/a> you won’t want to fill up your storage account with static content that never changes like old blog posts or images.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
