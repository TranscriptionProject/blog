A couple weeks ago I suggested [repeating your message](__GHOST_URL__/newsletter/newsletter-7-everything-is-an-opportunity-to-learn?&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=getting_senior_leaders_to_consider_your_proposals&utm_term=2020-09-09#try-to-over-communicate-i-dare-you) twenty one times for it to sink in. That might seem excessive, but my old manager [Viacheslav Kovalevskyi](https://twitter.com/b0noi) has used this tactic to **get senior leaders at Google to consider his proposals.**

He shares his tactics in the [The Nonintuitive Bits podcast, episode 31](http://www.thenonintuitivebits.com/673913/5360560-it-pays-to-over-communicate-episode-31?&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=getting_senior_leaders_to_consider_your_proposals&utm_term=2020-09-09)

**And now your nuggets for the week:**

1. Write down what you did at work. It pays at perf time.
2. Focus on a few things to get anything done
3. Your ideas are limited by where you express them

# #1 Write down what you did at work

How can I expect my manager to remember everything I did all year when I barely remember what I did last week?

[Andrew Yu](https://twitter.com/andrewcyu/utm_source=zainrizvi.io?&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=getting_senior_leaders_to_consider_your_proposals&utm_term=2020-09-09) suggests writing a quick email to your manager each week with a sentence on what you did, what you're going to do, and any problems you're running into.

It makes a huge difference

# #2 Focus or flounder

If focus is critical when a few people can share the load

What happens when you only have yourself?

# #3 The medium limits the message

My friend [Najla](https://twitter.com/NajlaAlariefy?&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=getting_senior_leaders_to_consider_your_proposals&utm_term=2020-09-09) had an epiphany: [The internet freed communication from the limits of transportation](https://najla.cc/independence-by-tech-how-humans-are-empowered/?utm_source=zainrizvi.io&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=getting_senior_leaders_to_consider_your_proposals&utm_term=2020-09-09)

And the idea is broader than that, there are numerous ways in which knowledge has been limited by the medium it was stored on:

* Books were limited by the speed a scribe could copy them at.This limitation was removed by a printing press.
* Equations were limited to those who could understand what was written on the paper. Now they're available to anyone who can click buttons to run a simulation.
* ML teaches computers to understand information so complex that humans can only understand it at an intuitive level.

And we're not done yet.

**Ideas are still limited by the limits of the software they're expressed in**.

Licklider noticed this potential half a century ago:

New note taking tools like [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/?utm_source=zainrizvi.io&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=getting_senior_leaders_to_consider_your_proposals&utm_term=2020-09-09) are removing some of those limits, but there's still a lot left to be decoupled.

**What tools have have you discovered that help you think?** Reply back and let me know! I'll share them in next week's newsletter.

Till next week
