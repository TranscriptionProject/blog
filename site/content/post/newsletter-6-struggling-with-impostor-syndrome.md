Two years into my first job at Microsoft, I was expecting to be fired.

I felt like I wasn't good enough, like I was only pretending to be smart. I spent years desperately trying to hide my incompetence from others.

{{< figure src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/6p501NMwlr21LiQ0s_4y4qr2FbnvXS3Y4UIm9uFtep1TrM-lMb3lLc9XtTc4I73VCINTDdtK8BH0nsfZy1ip6W2NJKF8K60H6vjFpLoh4BD3OWRhovBW2VfMLdg1xiuiooVeQV7HVj6z4V2ndg=s0-d-e1-ft#https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/when-someone-comments-on-my-design-doc.gif" >}}

Eventually I realized I had Impostor Syndrome, where qualified people belittle their own talents and are constantly being terrified of being discovered as a fraud.

This is a story about how **I struggled with impostor syndrome** and eventually **turned it into an advantage.**

Today I share my journey, and how you can also benefit from it

## What I'm reading

### [Useful isn't always Fruitful](https://click.mlsend.com/link/c/YT0xNDkxOTgzNjcyMjE0MDM0MDAyJmM9aDNtMiZlPTE5MjgmYj0zOTE2Mjk5ODkmZD1rM2oyejhl.3hsxbxaThaCUjHi2uPmVLA-Bndr3JAhtMhZRLWZ899w)

Always **remember who pays the bills**

In the 50s computers were used as giant calculators, not for email. Why? Email would be expensive, with unclear benefits

Engineers wanted to build it, but **the people who wanted it couldn't afford computers**. And the people who could afford it, didn't want it

### [Notice how the message is given](https://click.mlsend.com/link/c/YT0xNDkxOTgzNjcyMjE0MDM0MDAyJmM9aDNtMiZlPTE5MjgmYj0zOTE2Mjk5ODYmZD13Nnc3cTBz.YZNzYqZGs18svd12JuEaQC50lUjKyYuGGFSYh6Mr568)

It's easy to just enjoy the ride when consuming media. But **if you want to get better, focus on *how* it was presented**

What were the words, the phrases, the styles? Notice what catches your attention and think about why it works.

Then try it out yourself.

**Your actions determine your feelings**. **Tap into that** and _pay attention_

Did doing something feel pleasurable? Did you feel like you were mastering a skill? Pleasure & mastery are the two things that make us feel best

Focus on them, and the next steps will come naturally

## The Takeaway

Funny thing about impostor syndrome: it [doesn't go away](https://click.mlsend.com/link/c/YT0xNDkxOTgzNjcyMjE0MDM0MDAyJmM9aDNtMiZlPTE5MjgmYj0zOTE2Mjk5OTImZD1hNGE4ejJq.0JenMDTu019DE47GbqEyxUP1zoWvmYz2DCUpqX7Hx0Y) even when you know it's fake.

How have you dealt with your own impostor syndrome? Did you find a way to help others with theirs?
