In the past few days, some of my articles have really [hit a chord](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/igfn8p/whats_it_like_as_a_senior_engineer_my_experiences/) on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/iauwyt/how_i_stopped_abandoning_my_side_projects/) and [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24251068). I'm stoked to see them helping people. And they've led to a lot of new faces on the newsletter this week.

If you're one of them, welcome! Excited to have you all here on this journey.

I'm learning right alongside you, so feel free to bounce ideas around. **I would love to hear your own takes on anything I share.**

And now for your nuggets

# **What I'm writing**

### [Taking my own advice](__GHOST_URL__/blog/grow-by-giving-feedback/)

Youâ€™ve heard how the best way to learn is by teaching, right?

Wrong. Try grading instead.

The single best practice that improved my writing was reviewing other people's essays.

And now I'm realizing I can apply this at work. You can too.

# **What I'm reading**

### [Changing Minds](https://twitter.com/ZainRzv/status/1298643257711239168)

_An excerpt from The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, by Richard Hamming_

Want to change someone's mind? The direct approach may not work

Instead, try asking them to give advice to other people

They'll be happy do that

And they just might take their own advice

### [Try to over-communicate, I dare you](https://twitter.com/ZainRzv/status/1295766155441971200)

_An excerpt from Rise, by Patty Azzarello_

**It's impossible to over-communicate**

Think repeating a message five times is to much?

Try repeating it twenty one times instead! That's what it takes for a message to really sink in

### [The UX of Lego Interface Panels](https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/2020/LEGO-Interface-UX/?utm_source=zainrizvi.io&utm_medium=email)

This article is a quick lesson on how to design user interfaces to make the important things easy.

The six main ways to **make the important functionality stand** out:

* Size
* Shape
* Color
* Texture
* Position
* Operation (how it's used)

Lego used all of those when painting its toys

# **The Takeaway**

I was amazed when I noticed how much [reviewing other's works](__GHOST_URL__/blog/grow-by-giving-feedback/) helped me improve my own.

It started with essays, but now I'm trying to notice how people deliver lectures, write design documents, and even bug descriptions. I'm certain I haven't yet noticed all the things I could be learning from.

**Have you found yourself learning by watching others work?** I'd love to hear about it. Reply back and share your story! I read every email.

Till next week
