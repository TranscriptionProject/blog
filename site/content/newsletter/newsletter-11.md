At work, cutting scope is a way to potentially save weeks of effort. But **where does cutting scope cross the line into cutting corners?**

Slava and I try to find that line in:

**[The Nonintuitive Bits episode 25: Cutting Scope vs Cutting corners](http://www.thenonintuitivebits.com/673913/4353353-reducing-scope-vs-cutting-corners/?utm_source=zainrizvi.io&utm_medium=newsletter)**

**And now your nuggets for the week:**

1. Be your manager's second brain
2. Make others comfortable with giving feedback
3. Use a **bat signal** to attract like minds

## #1 Be your manager's second brain

Patty says it best:

_"Your boss wants you to push back. Your boss is expecting you to think through the business strategy and the workload and offer adviceâ€”not to just try and do everything."_

## #2 Make others comfortable with giving feedback

FBI Negotiator [Chris Voss](https://twitter.com/VossNegotiation) shares a trick for making the other person feel at ease with sharing their real concerns.What does he do? He invites corrections, and then says something which he _knows_ is wrong about them

## [#3 Use a bat signal to attract like minds](https://charity.wtf/2020/09/06/if-management-isnt-a-promotion-then-engineering-isnt-a-demotion/)

[Charity Majors](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy) loves to send bat signals.

Bat signal: A message that attracts people you like while repelling those you don't

A couple examples:

* Companies emphasizing "we work hard"
* People emphasizing cultural values

## Your Turn ðŸ‘Š

[Damien Ryan shared](https://twitter.com/djryan/status/1307238279566290944) his own bat signal.

He keeps using the word "empathy" in interviews and checks to see if the other person ever flinches.

**What other bat signals have you seen?**

Till next week
