Psychological safety at the workplace comes with tradeoffs.

Where should you draw the line between making it safe about their performance, while still requiring people to meet expectations? [Slava](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/YT0xNTM3NzgzOTE2OTgxNjU1NTE0JmM9dTR0OSZiPTQzNjkyNDU0OSZkPWo3bDh2NGY=.RQ37YVKDZ5JgcFuaNT-dXXxl-N9mNGJpysaf__9y9_M) and I grappled with this dilemma, and he offered a resolution:

**"Forgive mistakes, be ruthless about patterns"**

The full conversation is on [Forgive and forget? - Episode 36 of the Nonintuitive Bits podcast](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/YT0xNTM3NzgzOTE2OTgxNjU1NTE0JmM9dTR0OSZiPTQzNjkyNDU1MiZkPWo0YjJ6N3Y=._MHAPZxxRGRHgJAK96Ftyl912fD0joURpo_vx6gjwkk)

**Time zone madness part 2:** Last week's list of time zone misconceptions has doubled in size. I've written about all twenty one of them here and explained why each one is false in [Falsehoods programmers believe about time zones](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/YT0xNTM3NzgzOTE2OTgxNjU1NTE0JmM9dTR0OSZiPTQzNjkyNDU1NSZkPW41ejJ4Nmw=.k_U6DNXuXuxAjOlA85AmugwR-0SH-ug_K_ZP9Db7ZEA)

**Survey results:** Last week I asked if you have a 5 year plan. Here were your responses:

* Yes: 28%
* No: 55%
* Selected both 'Yes' and 'No': 17%

I think that third category were the folks who really wanted to know how the voting system was setup, lol

**Your nuggets for the week:**

1. Enhanced weekly status updates
2. Vet the company before you join
3. What does independent thinking look like?

# #1 Status Updates 2.0

A few weeks ago I [suggested](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/YT0xNTM3NzgzOTE2OTgxNjU1NTE0JmM9dTR0OSZiPTQzNjkyNDU1OCZkPXExeDhjN2k=.7HtIMxSt16Yi2qmgktDA7RGsQZ3U9EnsY5GzslC57K4) telling your manager what you did that week. Calvin French-Owen takes it to the next level

He [recommends](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/YT0xNTM3NzgzOTE2OTgxNjU1NTE0JmM9dTR0OSZiPTQzNjkyNDU2MSZkPWg3ZDF6OHc=.4dW7hETu3cBQl_HRuzHez5ajkkVLrpcug_vxFkK9tuk) expanding the audience to other stake holders and adding a fun tidbit to that newsletter, such as **including something you're learning**

I see a couple potential benefits of this approach:

* Folks are more excited to see your newsletter
* It's an opportunity for people to better understand how you think, which creates trust

As Patty Azzarello said in [Rise](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/YT0xNTM3NzgzOTE2OTgxNjU1NTE0JmM9dTR0OSZiPTQzNjkyNDU2NCZkPXU1YThjNGI=.iMJJBPa6DsUrofZI6Y9K6q7mznzvsGC7RH5vRA4gZmg):

_"Share your regular updates with your peers and boss too. Your excellent updates will get forwarded around, and **through your consistency, your sharing**, and your presence as a leader, **you will create huge amounts of trust**"_

I'll admit there might be some confirmation bias in me liking this approach, since that's basically what I'm doing with this newsletter ðŸ˜‰

## #2 Vet Companies before you join

Will Larson cautions engineers to be careful about [which companies they join](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/YT0xNTM3NzgzOTE2OTgxNjU1NTE0JmM9dTR0OSZiPTQzNjkyNDU2NyZkPXExbTV2M28=.IFHF5eL5D0WKBBLL5kgvy5QhLvKUKY8G7i92bbZ_pHc).

Different companies value different traits, and it pays to make sure you join one which values yours.

## #**3 What does independent thinking look like?**

Paul Graham offers a litmus test. The test isn't perfect, but it's a good rule of thumb:

## Y**our Turn ðŸ‘Š**

Time to practice some critical reading

**Can you spot any scenarios where Paul Graham's litmus test would fail?**

Reply back and share your thoughts. I respond to every message

Till next week
