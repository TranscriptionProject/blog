There goes 2020.

This was the year I started writing seriously. It started off as a way to [remember what I read](__GHOST_URL__/#why-i-write), with this newsletter being an effective [forcing function](__GHOST_URL__/newsletter/newsletter-17/).

So how did the year go?

* 17 articles written
* 6 became prominent on [HackerNews](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateEnd=1609866791&dateRange=custom&dateStart=1597190400&page=0&prefix=false&query=zainrizvi.io&sort=byPopularity&type=story) or [reddit.com/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=site%3Azainrizvi.io+subreddit%3Aprogramming&restrict_sr=&sort=top&t=year)
* 26 newsletters mailed out
* 1,346 of you all who found them worth subscribing to (I'm still shocked, but super grateful)
* The best part: New friends met along the way

As for those six articles, chances are you found me through one of them:

* [Interview advice that got me offers](__GHOST_URL__/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares/) - Unconventional interview advice
* [The impostor's advantage](__GHOST_URL__/blog/the-impostors-advantage/) - Turning impostor syndrome into a strength
* [What's it like being a Senior Engineer?](__GHOST_URL__/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/) - It's no longer about the code
* [I didn't want to abandon yet another side project](__GHOST_URL__/blog/do-more-by-doing-less/) - Cut scope & get more done
* [Remembering what you read: Zettelkasten vs P.A.R.A.](https://zainrizvi.io/blog/remembering-what-you-read-zettelkasten-vs-para/) - The note-taking philosophy that worked best for me
* [Falsehoods Programmers Believe about Time Zones](__GHOST_URL__/blog/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time-zones/)

I'm looking forward to continue learning, sharing, and meeting more folks. Some of the coolest stuff I've learned has been from [replies people sent](__GHOST_URL__/blog/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time-zones/#misconception-23-redditors-will-agree-these-are-all-misconceptions).

**Now, your nuggets for the week:**

1. **Hide complexity to get simplicity**
2. **Make Discovery Easy**
3. **Let people feel smart**

# #1 Hide complexity

# #2 Make discovery easy

"When people use something, they face two gulfs:

* The Gulf of Execution, where they try to figure out **how it operates**,
* The Gulf of Evaluation, where they try to figure out **what happened**

The role of the designer is to help people bridge the two gulfs."

# #3 Let them feel smart

When it works, your users get to discover something.

"When you build applications that **let users be smart, they love you for it**.

Set up situations where there is a problem that must besolved and let the user solve it.

Give them subtle clues, but donâ€™t take away that â€˜ahaâ€™ moment."
