Do you have people who disagree with you? My old coworkers from Google are happy to do it.

They're great to bounce ideas off of, and last October we started a podcast where we'd discuss our different views. It's called [The Nonintuitive Bits](http://www.thenonintuitivebits.com/?utm_source=zainrizvi.io&utm_medium=email)

My favorite part: **I always learn something new**

Here's one of my favorite episodes. We discuss:

* The **psychology** behind gamifying apps
* How to be a senior and even **staff engineer** (we're still figuring out the latter)
* How to have **great ideas** (is it even necessary?)

If you've been on this newsletter from the beginning while, you might recognize those topics. I shared them in [issue #2](__GHOST_URL__/newsletter/newsletter-2-senior-engineering/) of this newsletter, and then afterwards I got to hear those guys disagreeing with what I said ðŸ™‚

Listen to it here:

[**The Nonintuitive Bits Episode 29: Senior Engineering and Consumer Psychology**](http://www.thenonintuitivebits.com/673913/4938281-senior-engineering-and-consumer-psychology-episode-29?utm_source=zainrizvi.io&utm_medium=email)

And here are your weekly nuggets

## #1 Who should you work for?

It's been a learning process deciding who I should [build products for](https://twitter.com/ZainRzv/status/1218564839112507392) at work. But if you build for the wrong people, then you risk wasting your hard work.

"Successful people do their work and produce their results in a way that is meaningful and visible to people that count. **They understand which audiences matter most** and they communicate with the right people at the right times, in a compelling way"

-- _Excerpt from [Rise](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Practical-Advancing-Career-Standing/dp/1607742608), by Patty Azzarello_

## #2 Change minds before they say "no"

Before that moment, they're still open to possibilities.

But once someone says "no", **they stop considering alternatives**

## #3 Your Predictions are Wrong

Mine are too.

We always have just partial knowledge. Our model of the world [cannot](https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/?utm_source=zainrizvi.io&utm_medium=email) take everything into consideration.

Meaning, we're guaranteed to make wrong predictions.

Keep predicting, but proceed with humility.

Donâ€™t expect to all.

That's okay

## Your Turn ðŸ‘Š

**Have you ever had to decide which audience you should satisfy?**

This could be making your boss happy vs users happy, or any other conflict.

Reply back, I'd love to hear it! I respond to every email.

Till next week
