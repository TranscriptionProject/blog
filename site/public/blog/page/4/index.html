                            With such a large number of commits coming in, PyTorch needs a process for managing it all to keep the codebase maintainable. For smaller changes, like a five line bug fix, this takes the form of a regular PR review.  For larger changes, we prefer a Request for Comments

<h1 id="change-the-system-not-yourself">Change the system, not yourself</h1>
<p>There&rsquo;s a common mistake people made when following popular note taking or productivity systems, be it PARA, Zettelkasten, GTD, Bullet Journals, or anything else.</p>
<p>They assume each system is universal.</p>
<p>Those systems weren&rsquo;t built for mass consumption. Rather, their inventors had each felt a gap in their <em>own</em> abilities, where their previous systems didn&rsquo;t match their personalities. Like two jigsaw pieces that don&rsquo;t quite fit.</p>

                            <p>The smell of fresh pine sawdust filled the air, with more floating up as I sanded the last rough corner of the stool. My toddler was happily sanding her own block off to the side.</p>
<p>Woodworking was a new hobby I&rsquo;d picked up. My old ones, coding, reading, writing, had kept me stuck to my laptop, holed up by myself. Not very toddler friendly.</p>
<p>A surprise <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Decker-Junior-Workbench-Workshop-Realistic/dp/B0016DE80I">gift</a> laid the seeds of an idea. As a boy, the best summer days were when my dad and I would transform scratch wood into bird houses, planes, and eventually even rube goldberg devices. It was time to rekindle the flame.</p>

<p>It seemed so much simpler a month ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, could you integrate this tool into our service?&rdquo; my manager had asked. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d replied. &ldquo;How hard could it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Famous last words.</p>
<p>Now it was my job to take this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/blog/the-truth-about-vpc-security-controls/">convoluted</a> piece of security infrastructure, which I knew nothing about, which itself was still under active development, and wrangle it into submission.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just code, right?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Try grading instead. The single biggest practice that improved my writing was reviewing <em>other</em> people&rsquo;s essays. <a href="https://www.perell.com/">David Perell</a> made me do it.</p>
<p>I took his class Write of Passage, and on the very first day we were told to write an essay. And give feedback.</p>
<p>To random strangers.</p>
<p>About their essays.</p>
<p>That didn’t seem right.</p>
<p>He expected <em>me</em> to give advice? Wasn’t <em>he</em> the teacher? I <a href="__GHOST_URL__/blog/the-impostors-advantage/">wasn’t qualified</a> to do this, I barely knew how to write my own. That’s why I was taking the class!</p>

That’s a useful mental model for your company’s decision makers to think with, but the analogy quickly breaks down if you’re an engineer trying to actually implement VPC-SC protection for your GCP projects.</p>
<p>I learned that the hard way.</p>
<p>Here I’ll describe just what VPC-SC is, why it was needed, and a big mistake I made which you reeeally want to make sure you avoid.</p>

And creativity is something you can generate on demand through deep work, and in his book “Deep Work” Cal explains how you can achieve it.

                            <p>I recently discovered that it’s possible to combine any domain that you own with your Gmail account and a free MailGun account to get a free custom domain email address!</p>
<p>When you’re done following the below instructions you’ll be able to send and receive emails addressed to <a href="mailto:you@yourdomain.com">you@yourdomain.com</a> directly from your Gmail inbox.</p>

<p>Okay, so you still have to pay to own your domain, but the rest is free. And if you want a custom domain email address, then chances are you’re interested in your professional reputation. Owning your own domain is a good idea even if you don’t plan to start your own sure just yet. I held off on it a couple years and that was enough for a law student to grab zainrizvi.com -_-</p>

<p>In today’s world the most valuable employees are the ones who can tackle complex problems. And the best of those are the ones who can make the complex problems look simple.</p>
<p>But how can someone actually do that? Below are some tactics I’ve used which can make a big difference.</p>
<p>These tactics are designed to get me thinking about the problem space in different ways. The different perspectives often yield insights that help separate the core components into smaller, more manageable units (and of course this list is always a work in progress)</p>

<p>When presented with any new information think about:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><strong>Evidence</strong></strong>: Why do you think this information is true or false? What should count? What do you think you know and why?</li>
<li><strong><strong>Viewpoints</strong></strong>: How would this look from other perspectives? How would other people or companies think about this differently?</li>
<li><strong><strong>Connections</strong></strong>: Noticing any patterns? Have you seen something like this before?</li>
<li><strong><strong>Conjecture</strong></strong>: What if something about this was different? How would that impact things?</li>
<li><strong><strong>Relevance</strong></strong>: Why does this matter?</li>

<p>I tried using yeoman’s gulp-angular generator. I made a quick site following their <a href="http://yeoman.io/codelab/index.html">tutorial</a>, setup <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-publish-source-control/">continuous deployment via github</a>, navigated to the newly deployed site and I saw…huh?</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Azure Web Apps provides powerful <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-backup/">backup/restore functionality</a>. (Because disasters can <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/international-backup-awareness-day/">happen to anyone</a>)</p>
<p>However, sometimes you don’t want to backup everything on your site, especially if you backup your site regularly, or if your site has over 10GB of content (that’s the max amount you can backup at a time).</p>
<p>For example, you probably don’t want to back up the log files. Or if you <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-backup/#configure-automated-backups">setup weekly backups</a> you won’t want to fill up your storage account with static content that never changes like old blog posts or images.</p>
