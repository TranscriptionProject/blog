&lt;p>Your nuggets for the week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Motivation comes from Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People aren&amp;rsquo;t that logical&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pick your ideas apart&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="1-motivation-comes-from-autonomy-mastery-and-purpose">#1 Motivation comes from Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Three factors which get you exited to do a task:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Autonomy&lt;/strong>: You feel like you&amp;rsquo;re in control and doing what you think is best. The choices are yours to make, and not forced upon you by someone else.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mastery&lt;/strong>: You feel like you&amp;rsquo;re improving.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Purpose&lt;/strong>: The task is in service of a higher cause, or in service of others. It&amp;rsquo;s something bigger than yourself&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Autonomy is particularly tricky. Even telling something to do a thing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZainRzv/status/1288363472015646720">they might have done anyways&lt;/a> can kill their motivation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Newsletter #27 - Managing Up</title><link>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/newsletter/newsletter-27-managing-up/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 18:31:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/newsletter/newsletter-27-managing-up/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey folks,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s nuggets:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Complement your manager&amp;rsquo;s skillset&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ask for what you want&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prove your work is important&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get others to prove your case&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="1-complement-your-managers-skills">#1 Complement your manager&amp;rsquo;s skills&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Learn your manager&amp;rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses (they exist, he&amp;rsquo;s not perfect).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you can send him opportunities to do more of what he&amp;rsquo;s good at, while shoring up his weaknesses with your own strengths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And shoring up his weaknesses will teach you how to be a manager yourself!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Newsletter #26 - 2020 in Review</title><link>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/newsletter/newsletter-26-make-your-users-feel-smart/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 17:28:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/newsletter/newsletter-26-make-your-users-feel-smart/</guid><description>&lt;p>There goes 2020.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was the year I started writing seriously. It started off as a way to &lt;a href="__GHOST_URL__/#why-i-write">remember what I read&lt;/a>, with this newsletter being an effective &lt;a href="__GHOST_URL__/newsletter/newsletter-17/">forcing function&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how did the year go?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>17 articles written&lt;/li>
&lt;li>6 became prominent on &lt;a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateEnd=1609866791&amp;amp;dateRange=custom&amp;amp;dateStart=1597190400&amp;amp;page=0&amp;amp;prefix=false&amp;amp;query=zainrizvi.io&amp;amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;amp;type=story">HackerNews&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/search?q=site%3Azainrizvi.io+subreddit%3Aprogramming&amp;amp;restrict_sr=&amp;amp;sort=top&amp;amp;t=year">reddit.com/r/programming&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>26 newsletters mailed out&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1,346 of you all who found them worth subscribing to (I&amp;rsquo;m still shocked, but super grateful)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The best part: New friends met along the way&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

That greed was a virtue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It sounded iffy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may have noticed the opposite yourself:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How did you feel the last time you worked on a project which you didn&amp;rsquo;t care about, but you still got paid well?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How long before the itch to do something else started?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And try flipping the script&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How did you feel when you last helped someone and made a difference to them?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How do you feel like when you&amp;rsquo;re playing video games?&lt;/li>

&lt;p>But&amp;hellip;something was off.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yes, the amenities were great. The food was delicious. My teammates were fun to be with, we&amp;rsquo;d even play board games every week.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For me, it happens about every three years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most recent one happened last January, when Naseem Taleb&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/34BtNHV">Antifragile&lt;/a> pointed out a false belief I&amp;rsquo;d been holding my whole life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I used to think &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;If it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been scientifically proven, it must not be true&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s crazy how we think anything can be scientifically proven true when the scientific method itself is designed to only debunk theories, not prove them.

&lt;p>Yes, there&amp;rsquo;s google, but that requires a certain level of technical sophistication. You still have to open it and use the right search term. It adds friction.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I certainly did.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until later that I realized &lt;strong>asking questions can be a powerful tool for being creative&lt;/strong> and generating insights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you ask &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;What if?&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;How?&amp;rdquo;, &lt;strong>you reshape the way you see the world&lt;/strong>. You notice connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. Your ideas cross pollinate.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Newsletter #12 - My sister got scammed.

It’s easy to tell &lt;em>other&lt;/em> people where their essays could be improved. Something will feel off. I’ll notice friction. It’ll be hard to read even if I’m not sure why. It’s hard to get that feeling when I read my own writing, I’m too close to it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Newsletter #4 - Community Edition</title><link>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/newsletter/newsletter-4-community-edition/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2020 19:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/newsletter/newsletter-4-community-edition/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last weekend I had a huge zoom call with my extended family. Parents with nine siblings each equals many, many cousins. I met cousins who I hadn&amp;rsquo;t talked to in years, saw nephews and nieces I&amp;rsquo;ve never met, and enjoyed old family stories I&amp;rsquo;d never heard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a moment of connection and rekindling old ties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen often enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those communal ties kept coming up in one form or another this week.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Newsletter #3 - Navigating the Workplace</title><link>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/newsletter/newsletter-3-navigating-the-workplace/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 07:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/newsletter/newsletter-3-navigating-the-workplace/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how much the simple act of writing down your ideas helps you think 🤯&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That happened to me this week. I&amp;rsquo;m writing an article about altruism (you&amp;rsquo;ll see it next week), and I had originally planned to highlight the mindset that&amp;rsquo;s often missing. But as I started writing, and was forced to think about it from more angles, I realized the mindset depends on &lt;em>who&lt;/em> you&amp;rsquo;re helping. And why donating $100 to the poor doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you feel as good as offering one homeless person a $10 meal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Newsletter #2 - Senior Engineering</title><link>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/newsletter/newsletter-2-senior-engineering/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2020 06:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/newsletter/newsletter-2-senior-engineering/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I said that I&amp;rsquo;m taking an online writing class called Write of Passage. What made me sign up for it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, I read a lot. I mean a &lt;strong>LOT&lt;/strong>. Like, the-librarian-knows-me-by-name a lot. But often the fascinating stuff I&amp;rsquo;d learn would trickle out of my brain by the next day hour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I discovered something which kept those ideas fresh: &lt;strong>Writing them down&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I wrote them down, the ideas were not only easier to remember but I was also forced think about them more deeply: &amp;ldquo;I believe A because B is true&amp;hellip;.wait, am I sure B is actually true?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Newsletter #1 - Interview Advice</title><link>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/newsletter/newsletter-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2020 06:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://transcriptionproject.github.io/blog/newsletter/newsletter-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently started David Perell’s course “Write of Passage”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s an intensive 5 week class teaching how to extract all those thoughts in your head and put them down on paper. It’s a grueling pace, where you have to write an essay every week, but I’m hoping that it’ll build help me build the habit so that I can keep it up even after the class is over and continue sharing what I’ve learned over the years.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
