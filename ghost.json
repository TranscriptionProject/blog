But\nthe cool insights I'd learnt often trickled out of my brain by the next morning.\n\nThen I  discovered one trick which kept those ideas fresh:  Writing them down\n\nWhen I wrote them down, not only were the ideas easier to remember but I was\nalso forced think about them more deeply: \"I believe A because B is\ntrue....wait, am I sure B is actually true?\"\n\nAs I wrote them down, it seemed a shame to keep 'em locked away to myself. So I\ndecided to start a newsletter summarizing the best of what I learn.\n\nBut isn't everything already on the internet,  you ask?

And all that experience made me realize\nsomething:\n\nToo many good engineers fail interview loops just because they can't interview\nwell.\n\nIt's not their fault.\n\nConventional interview advice only covers 1/3 of what's actually needed to pass\ntech interviews.\n\nNo wonder folks think those interviews are hard.\n\nIt's time to level the playing field. Here's the insider's guide on how to pass\nFAANG interviews.\n\nYou'll get:\n\n * 1.5 hours of content containing interview and career advice I had to learn\n   the hard way\n * A list of the best interview prep resources I've found\n\nGet the course\n[https://zainrizvi.gumroad.com/l/insider-advice-on-how-you-can-pass-faang-interviews/welcome_screen?wanted=true]\n\nWhat do I write about? 🤔\nI love to read about software engineering, business, and psychology, and how\nthey relate to each other.

But you’re out of ideas, and\nare looking to interviewees for suggestions”\n\nThat’s the actual response I gave the interviewer the first time I was asked a\ndesign question. He had a good laugh. But then still made me design the service.\n\nIn the decade since I’ve lost track of how many hours I’ve spent in the\ninterview room, on both sides of the table. I’ve worked at Microsoft, Google,\nand Stripe, and received offers from many other companies. As I interviewed, I\nrealized one thing: standard interviewing advice falls woefully short.\n\nWhat good does it do to practice coding problems for weeks if your mind goes\nblank in an interview room? Everyone says to be wary of the recruiters, but what\nif you weren’t? How can you show your “best self” if you’re too afraid to let it\nout?\n\nI tested the answers to these questions multiple times (sometimes by accident).\nTurns out conventional wisdom gets you conventional results. But you can do\nbetter. Interviewing is a skill and anyone can learn it.\n\nFor some reason no one talks about these aspects of interviewing, but I’ve found\nthem helpful time and time again.\n\nWe’ll cover:\n\n * Using recruiters to your advantage\n * Going to real interviews for practice\n * Being open to learning during interviews\n * Keeping those skills sharp even when you’re not job hunting\n\nTip #1: Use recruiters to your advantage\nTheir voice sounds so friendly and helpful when you chat with them on the phone.\n“Zain, I’m looking forward to seeing you when you come for your interview!”\nClearly it’s all an act, past-me assumed. I was sure they were secretly judging\nme, deciding if I was good enough to work at the company.\n\nAnd they do judge. But not in the way I was expecting.\n\nRecruiters aren’t evaluating you technically, not by the time you pick up the\nphone anyways. Their decision on whether you have the technical chops to be\nworth interviewing was made well before that call. If you’re being offered an\ninterview: Congratulations, you've already passed that bar\n\nNow the recruiter wants to work with you. Their whole job is to, you know,\nrecruit. They know that you statistically have poor interview prep skills, and\nare happy to help fix that flaw. Why discard strong candidates who can’t\ninterview well? They’ll level the playing field by helping everyone show their\nbest selves when interviewing.\n\nHow can you take advantage of this?\n\nAsk them questions! Things like:\n\n * “What should I do to prepare for the interview?”\n * “What are the company values that would be good to highlight during the\n   interview?”\n\nAnd be forthright about any problems you run into:\n\n * If you get sick the day before the interview, call up the recruiter and ask\n   to reschedule. They want to test you when you're at your best!\n * Work pressures left you with no time to prepare? You can still try\n   rescheduling. At worst they'll say \"sorry, we can't do that\". It will not\n   hurt your chances of getting in\n\nYour mad technical skills no longer matter to them. If anything, humility and an\nopenness to learning will show you in the best light.\n\nTip #2: Go to real interviews for practice\nYou need to build up your interviewing skills. LeetCode is great, but it doesn’t\ncome close to the real thing. Try to interview at actual companies as much as\npossible. And don't limit yourself to the companies you care about.\n\nLearn to deal with pressure\n\nWhen you're in a real interview the world changes: You're locked in a cage with\na lion. Every heartbeat is a gorilla bashing against the walls. Your mental\ngears gunk up as your body goes into fight or flight mode. Your clammy hands\nstruggle to write half legible code on the white board. A threat hides behind\nevery shadow. Even an innocuous \"Would you like something to drink?\" is a\nnefarious test: do I pick coke or coffee?\n\nYou only get that experience in a real interview. And only real interviews teach\nyou how to deal with it. The first interview will kick your ass. So will the\nsecond. But once you get a few under your belt you'll get used to the adrenaline\nrush. Perhaps enjoy it even. You'll become a bullfighter, confidently facing\ndown the charging bull. That’s how you get over the fear.\n\nYou may even find that these practice interviews are much easier! When the\nstakes are low that lion doesn't look so fierce. I've found that I perform the\nbest in the interviews where I don't care about the outcome. I'm much more\nrelaxed and at ease. I can think faster, my brain reaches out to more\npossibilities. Now, even in important interviews I try to convince myself that I\ndon't really care. That mindset shift is only possible because I got to\nexperience it in the low stakes games first.\n\nLearn to answer the more ambiguous questions\n\nAnd what about the questions? After each interview write down all the questions\nyou were asked. The same evening look over the questions while they’re still\nfresh in your mind. Focus especially on the behavioral and design ones which\nhave no clear right answer. Consider how you could have responded better. Are\nthere stories from your life you could have referenced? Wait a few days and look\nat them again. You’ll find better answers.\n\nEach answer you prepare this way becomes a blob of paint on your pallet. Chances\nare high that you'll come across similar questions in future interviews. Over\ntime you'll be able to mix the answers from your pallet to paint a picture\nhighlighting how your abilities make you a valuable asset to the company.\n\nStay open to serendipity\n\nAs you do these interviews, you may discover that the “practice” company is\nactually interesting after all.

Its core idea is to create atomic notes, where each note is about exactly one topic (not more than a few paragraphs tops) and nothing more. Then you file the away in your system by linking that note to other notes which seem most relevant to it. All the notes are written in your own words, so you’re really writing down your own thoughts here.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-2--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"616\" height=\"412\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-2--1-.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-2--1-.png 616w\"></figure><p>The key here is that the linking process <strong><strong>groups relevant notes together</strong></strong>. Now when you’re interested in browsing your notes on a given topic, you’ll easily find them. You get to see how your ideas relate to each other as well as discover interesting ways they may play off against or even contradict one another.</p><p>But this technique is time intensive. You have to:</p><ul><li>Save the initial note, paraphrasing what you learned</li><li>Search for relevant notes to link it to</li><li>Potentially update your table of contents to find that note more easily later on</li></ul><p>If you take a lot of notes, the stream of incoming notes can quickly leave you overwhelmed.

Let’s say you’re trying to build an app. You’ll have a folder called ‘app’ for all notes about it.

By creating purpose-based folders and putting all notes related to that <em>purpose</em> inside it, we’ve created a new way to group relevant notes together.

Just drop the note in the right folder and BAM, that’s it.</p><p>How do you reference old notes? When you start working on a new project (like a writing assignment) you search the relevant folders and pull out notes that seem relevant to your task.

Just in Time linking.</p><p>When you finish a project, you file away the notes from that project in which ever folder you think they’ll be most useful in, and then archive the project folder.

That’s a fancy way to describe preventing adversaries from copying\nyour private data off of your servers and onto their own.\n\nYou can setup many types of protections to prevent attackers from getting access\nto your machines (let’s strong with decent passwords, shall we?), but following\nthe principle of defense in depth\n[https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/defense-in-depth/],\nenterprises with more critical data protection requirements sometimes need an\nadditional layer of protection which says “Even if someone hacks into our\nmachines, joke’s on them. They still can’t steal our data!” That’s the core\nproblem we’re trying to solve here.\n\nThis problem has been around for a while. How was it solved in the pre-cloud\nera?\n\nBack then, companies would have a private corporate network. All employee\ncomputers would be inside that network, and that network would have a set of\nstrict firewall rules setup to prevent data from being passed to the outside\nworld. The firewall would only be opened up for a few, strictly vetted sites\nthat employees had real business need to access.\n\nThis way, even if an attacker gained access to a machine they still would not be\nable to send a copy of the data to themselves. The firewall would block any such\nattempts.\n\nNow what changes if you move to the cloud? Not too much actually!\n\nYou can define firewall rules for your cloud VMs as well and you can set those\nup to match very similar rules to what your local company network had.\n\nBut what if you wanted to use any of the other mouth watering array of services\nGCP offers? Things like blob storage, pub sub, or juptyer notebooks as a\nservice?\n\nThose services live outside the reach of your firewalls. They’re run on servers\nwhich are the entry point for resources owned by all GCP customers.\n\nThe usual solution of opening up a firewall hole to allow traffic just to those\nservices doesn’t quite work. Take Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for example, it’s\nspecifically designed to store data so it would be trivial for an attacker to\ntake your secret data, push it to their own GCS bucket and then download the\ndata from there at their leisure.\n\nSome companies worked around this problem by self-hosting their own versions of\nthese services within their private corporate networks. That’s an option, but\nit’s expensive. You have to run, debug, maintain, and upgrade both the software\nand servers, all by yourself. Your dev ops team is cursed to toil away in the\nkitchen making boiled chicken, while longingly looking upon the duck confit\n[https://images.app.goo.gl/KedFe6Tui7kKR7cc7] delivered to their neighbor’s\ndoorsteps.\n\nVPC-SC provides a better way.\n\nVPC-SC to the Rescue\nAt a high level, VPC-SC controls are settings you can define across your\nprojects that help you eat from the GCP buffet without worrying about an\nalligator eating you [https://youtu.be/YbFnrkeH7IA?t=11].\n\nThese settings are called your VPC-SC perimeter. You create and enable a VPC-SC\nperimeter (the virtual firewall) by defining three things:\n\n * A list of GCP services that you want to set on lockdown mode\n * The specific projects of yours that the lockdown mode should be applied to\n * Exceptions you want to make to the above policy (via Access Context Manager\n   [https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs]), but let’s ignore\n   this category\n\nLet’s call the set of projects in the perimeter P. By adding GCP services and\nprojects to the perimeter you’re saying you want to see the following behavior\nimplemented by each of those services:\n\n * Data Ingress limits: the service shouldn’t allow anything outside the P\n   projects in to read/write data to P. So data is never read from outside the\n   perimeter.\n * Data Egress limits: The service shouldn’t allow projects P to write data\n   anywhere except in one of the P projects. So data never gets written outside\n   the perimeter.\n\nThe above two clauses put together tell GCP Services to make sure your data\nstays inside your projects.\n\nSo you’ve combined the traditional firewall + DNS rules that were used to\nprotect computers, and added a layer of VPC-SC service level protection on top\nof that. These combine to protect your resources from data exfiltration.\n\nHow? Now, the only way to access your project’s data is from your VM, which is\nprotected by your custom firewall rules. Even if an adversary manages to get a\nhold of your GCP credentials they still wouldn’t be able to steal your data.\nThey would first have to breach your firewall to enter your VPC-SC perimeter!\n(Defense in depth!)\n\nAnd that’s how you get the virtual firewall!\n\nThe more astute among you may have noticed that the VPC-SC controls actually\nhave nothing to do with your VPC network. I never asked, but I assume the name\nVPC-SC was chosen for marketing purposes to make the ‘virtual firewall’ analogy\neasier to accept\n\nThe Big Misunderstanding\nThere’s one horrible assumption that people tend to make when setting up VPC-SC\nnetworks. I made this mistake too and spent a long time trying to debug it\nbefore I realized what I was doing wrong.\n\nNotice how you’re adding services into your VPC-SC perimeter to enable the\n“lockdown mode”? What happens if you don’t add some service to the perimeter? My\nnaïve assumption was that it would be blocked and inaccessible to my VMs.\n\nThat is absolutely, completely, 100% not the case.\n\nIn fact, if you don’t add a service to your VPC-SC perimeter then you’ve\nbasically left the route open for your internal VMs to send data to that service\nbut neglected to lock down that service itself. Chickens are in the hen house,\nbut the door is left wide open.\n\nHere comes the fox ready to exfiltrate your data!\n\nIn case that wasn’t clear: *You must to opt-in to every__ service ***that you\nwant to have locked-down. Opting-out means **zero protection.\n\nThere were probably good technical reasons for setting this up as the default\nbehavior. The first guess which comes to mind would be that not all GCP services\nsupport the VPC-SC lockdown yet. But boy, you can really get caught with your\npants down if you don’t see this one coming.\n\nHow do you protect yourself against this? First step is to include all services\nthat you actually plan to use in your VPC-SC perimeter. Then, block all the\nservices that you do not plan to use. I’m not sure what the recommended way to\ndo this is (probably something at either the DNS or the IAM levels) but that’s\nwhat you’ll want to do. Otherwise you’ll have left a hole wide open that’s big\nenough for an adversary to drive a Humvee full of chickens through.\n\nPlease don’t do that\n\nThe Power is Yours\nThere’s a quick overview of what VPC-SC controls offer you and what they don’t.\nHope this helped you get a better understanding of how to set it up.\n\nIf you have any thoughts, war stories, or corrections, shout out in the comments\nand let me know!","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1547190027-9156686aa2f0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-07-10T01:08:01.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-10T01:18:54.000Z","published_at":"2020-02-22T02:08:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"5f123d248f96fd003930da33","uuid":"4a2dd792-1532-4d96-aad0-0494e60dc93f","title":"So you want to do Deep Work?","slug":"so-you-want-to-deep-work","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://fs.blog/2014/05/improving-your-performance/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://hbr.org/2009/09/death-by-information-overload\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000389860/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2016/07/how-to-find-happiness-3/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Deep Work has been called “the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task.” Other people call this being in the state of “flow” or “being in the zone” where you can effortlessly focus on your work and be incredibly productive.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"“‘The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.’… this mental state [is] Flow”\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"In this information era where all mechanical tasks are being automated, in order to be successful you need to be able to do what machines cannot: be creative.

And creativity is something you can generate on demand through deep work, and in his book “Deep Work” Cal explains how you can achieve it.</p><p>Below are the key takeaways I had from his book, with a bunch of my own thoughts sprinkled in.</p><h1 id=\"your-motivation-is-the-key\">Your Motivation is the Key</h1><p><em>“the skillful management of attention is…the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.”</em></p><p>Deep Work requires you to concentrate on a topic for long stretches of time. This is an extremely challenging task unless the topic is something that you feel highly motivated to work on.</p><p>What happens if you try to work on a task you’re not motivated about? You procrastinate. And delay. And do almost anything else except work on that one task. You might slowly make progress, but you’ll be terribly inefficient.</p><p>But if you’re motivated to do something, we can spend hours working on it non-stop and not even feel tired afterwards. We need to harness this motivation.</p><p>Even if we feel motivated for a while, our brains are fickle things and sometimes get distracted anyways. It helps to have additional layers of motivation to help us stay motivated to work towards our goals. It’s like multiple hands pushing you in the direction you want to go.</p><p>Here are some specific tactics to help us stay motivated:</p><h2 id=\"tactic-1-focus-on-what-you-really-care-about\">Tactic #1: Focus on What You REALLY Care About</h2><p>The first step to being strongly motivated is to focus <em>only</em> on the tasks you really care about.</p><p>You need to manage your attention so that you don’t have to force yourself to work. Don’t make yourself say ‘no’ to things you want to do. Instead, find the productive things that you are really longing to do and say ‘yes’ to them. That ‘yes’ will be effortless.</p><p>For example, you didn’t have to force yourself away from Facebook to watch the last Avengers movie. When you had a chance to watch the movie, Facebook didn’t even enter your mind.</p><p>Find work that captures your attention the same way</p><p><em>“To win the battle for willpower, don’t try to say ‘no’ to the things you want to avoid. Instead try to say ‘yes’ to the subject that arouses terrifying longing, and let that terrifying longing crowd out everything else”</em></p><h2 id=\"tactic-2-create-fast-feedback-loops\">Tactic #2: Create Fast Feedback Loops</h2><p>This is both a productivity tip and a motivational hack.</p><p>Fast <a href=\"https://fs.blog/2014/05/improving-your-performance/\">feedback loops</a> are when you can quickly measure a result which tells you how effectively you’re working.</p><p>Creating feedback loops help you figure out how we’ll you’re progressing towards your goal. The faster you can tell that you’re veering off track, the better.</p><p>And seeing that you’re doing good work (or that you need to improve) can push you do keep going or work harder. Conversely, if you can’t see the effects of your actions, you’ll stop caring (goodbye motivation).</p><p>Cal specifically mentions measuring what he calls ‘lead measures’, which are items which imply you will be successful (e.g. hours spent in deep work, or mini tasks that you’ve completed). He contrasts that to ‘lag measures’ like number of sales, since the latter takes a lot longer to acquire, meaning it’ll take a lot longer to get that feedback.</p><p>It can be tricky to identify good lead measures, but they should be behaviors that would drive success on the lag measures. But the general idea is to see how you can get feedback as fast as possible, which is in line with many other popular philosophies such as MVPs and Fail Fast.</p><h2 id=\"tactic-3-compete-and-win\">Tactic #3: Compete and Win</h2><p>Add to your motivation by competing against yourself (or others) with a scoreboard. Cal suggests that people play differently when they’re keeping score. This is really another way of using your lead measures, but you are now attaching a goal to the lead measures and getting your psychology involved as well.</p><p>Note that it’s best if you don’t make this a public competition, otherwise you run the risk of optimizing for the wrong metric (the score board) instead of the actual value the score board was meant to represent.</p><p>Examples of score boards:</p><ul><li>Outcomes from your feedback loops</li><li>Number of hours spent in deep work per day/week</li><li>Number of lead measures</li><li>Number of customer sign ups</li></ul><h2 id=\"tactic-4-regular-accountability\">Tactic #4: Regular Accountability</h2><p>Have regular meetings of any team that owns a wildly important goal. This could be you setting up a time (weekly or daily) to go over the past weeks scores and plan how to improve the next week. This also plays into the feedback loops that you’re creating and is another angle through which you can make sure your motivation stays high. Social accountability can be a surprisingly motivating lever.</p><p>If you’re working solo, you can create accountability in other ways. You can commit to giving regular updates to a group of friends, or to post them on a public forum where your peers will see it.</p><p>This tactic can be seen as a variant of a precommitment device</p><h2 id=\"tactic-5-work-with-great-intensity\">Tactic #5: Work with Great Intensity</h2><p>Take your goals, estimate how long it’ll take to complete, and give yourself a drastically reduced deadline. Commit to it publicly if possible, and then work intensely to make it happen.</p><p>This is kind of like how in school you it would be impossible to write that essay a week before it was due. Yet the day before the deadline words would suddenly pour forth from your fingertips like magic.</p><p>Personally, I find it next to impossible to take a self-imposed deadline seriously. I have to pair it with external accountability by telling someone else when about that deadline. Knowing that I’ll have to report my status to that second person suddenly makes that deadline real.</p><h1 id=\"create-a-structure-for-your-deep-work\">Create a Structure for your Deep Work</h1><p>Many creatives know the pain of sitting in front of a black piece of paper and then thinking ‘now what’? The best people use a formula that works for them. It seems counterintuitive to use a formula for creativity, but people are most creative when we are given certain limitations (otherwise we risk <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2009/09/death-by-information-overload\">information overload</a>). Those people have a specific pattern of actions that help them focus and concentrate, and you’ll want to develop one for yourself that you’ll use to do your deep thinking.</p><p>There’s no one fixed formula because it’ll vary based on your industry, the type of work you do, and even your personality.</p><p>However, you can take the following formula as a starting point. Then overtime you’ll build on it and adjust it to meet your own needs</p><p>Starting structure:</p><ol><li>Carefully review the relevant <strong><strong>variables</strong></strong> for solving the problem (the things you can affect) and store them in memory</li><li>Define the <strong><strong>next-step</strong></strong> question you need to answer using those variables. Now you have a specific target for your attention</li><li><strong><strong>Focus</strong></strong> on your question and try to find an answer using the variables</li><li><strong><strong>Consolidate</strong></strong> your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you arrived at</li></ol><p>There are also a couple pitfalls in your thinking you should watch out for:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Distractions:</strong></strong> thinking about other things besides the really important goal you have</li><li><strong><strong>Looping:</strong></strong> Going over the same problem again and again, rehashing old results without diving deeper into it. When you notice the loop, catch yourself and shift your attention to the next step</li></ul><h1 id=\"discarding-distractions-embracing-boredom-finding-focus\">Discarding Distractions + Embracing Boredom = Finding Focus</h1><p>You have to be able to focus on your deep work. Without this skill, your mind will constatly be wandering to all the distractions constantly bombarding you for attention.</p><p>Being able to focus is a skill in and of itself, and you can develop that skill. When you concentrate on something regularly every day (e.g. meditation) you are building up your concentration muscles which will help you have laser focus in other areas of your life.</p><p>The way you get better at focusing is to force yourself to get distracted less.</p><p>Distractions are things like:</p><ul><li>Email</li><li>Social media &amp; web surfing</li><li>Most of the internet really (you can define specific kinds of internet use as acceptable if it’s critical to your work)</li><li>99% of alerts on your phone</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Don’t take breaks from Distraction, take breaks from Focus.</strong></strong> Focus should be your default state of mind. Only allow yourself to be distracted at predefined times.</p><p>You can schedule the occasional break from focus where you can give in to distractions. It has a side benefit of also training yourself to delay gratification.</p><p><strong><strong>Implementation tips:</strong></strong></p><ol><li>If you need that distraction frequently (e.g. you’re expected to be responsive to email) , then schedule shorter, more frequent, “distraction” breaks</li><li>Absolutely no distractions during the distraction free time. You must resist temptation, even when it seems important, this is training your brain</li><li>Schedule distraction time at home as well as work. Your brain should be trained to always be in focus mode, even if the thing you’re focusing on is family.</li><li>Turn off all non-critical notifications on your phone</li><li>Enable Do not Disturb mode on your phone by default, maybe just allowing phone calls to come through. You can check your phone for notifications during your distraction breaks or set it up to automatically disable Do not Disturb mode during your breaks</li></ol><h1 id=\"cut-out-your-time-wasters\">Cut out your Time Wasters</h1><p>Eliminate activities that don’t help you achieve your goals.</p><p>Cal called this rule “Quit Social Media” but it’s really about removing your biggest time wasters. The logic also applies to TV, YouTube, web surfing, etc.</p><p>Social media (and your other time wasters) are tools. They have both positive and negative effects, though the negative comes much more easily.</p><p><strong><strong>The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection:</strong></strong> Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweighed its negative impacts</p><p><strong><strong>Apply the 80/20 Rule to Your Internet Habits.</strong></strong> Figure out which 20% of your online time gives you 80% of the value.</p><p>To do this you need to:</p><ol><li>Identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and personal life</li><li>For each goal, list the two or three most important activities that help you satisfy the goal.</li></ol><ul><li>The activities should be specific enough to allow you to clearly picture doing them, but general enough to not be tied to a one-time outcome</li></ul><ol><li>Consider the network tools you currently use</li></ol><ul><li>For each, ask whether the tool has a substantially positive, substantially negative, or little impact on the above identified activities.</li><li>Only use tools that are substantially positive</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself!</strong></strong> Make deliberate use of your time outside work. The internet is like a time machine that fast forwards you through hours of your life (like in the movie ‘<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000389860/\">Click</a>’).</p><p><strong><strong>Put more thought into your leisure time.</strong></strong> Think ahead how you want to spend you free time later that day or on a future day. You can use that time to focus on things shown to <a href=\"https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2016/07/how-to-find-happiness-3/\">increase happiness</a>, such as improving your relationships, engaging in structured hobbies, enjoy nature, etc.</p><h1 id=\"remove-shallow-work-as-much-as-possible\">Remove Shallow Work as much as Possible</h1><p>Shallow work consists of noncognitively demanding, logistical style tasks, that you can often perform while distracted (e.g. filling forms, sending emails). Essentially it’s any work that’s not deep work.</p><p>These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate .</p><p>Shallow work that increasingly dominates the time and attention of knowledge workers is less vital than it often seems in the moment. Replacing shallow work with deep work means you do more work which is actually profitable. (Of course, there is a limit to how much shallow work you can actually cut out)</p><p>Deep work is cognitively exhausting. In the beginning, an hour a day is a reasonable amount of deep work time. Experts can do up to four hours, but rarely more.</p><p>The rest of the time can be spent in shallow work.</p><p>The <strong><strong>following are tactics designed to push you to not waste time on shallow work</strong></strong>. They’re all designed around getting you to deliberately choose how you’re spending your time</p><h2 id=\"tactic-1-schedule-every-minute-of-your-day\">Tactic #1: Schedule Every Minute of Your Day</h2><p>At the beginning of each workday, divide your day into blocks and write what activity you’ll be doing in each block.</p><p>Issues that’ll come up: your estimates were wrong, and other obligations/interruptions will come your way unexpectedly</p><p>That’s okay, just remake your schedule the first chance you get.

Without this skill, your mind\nwill constatly be wandering to all the distractions constantly bombarding you\nfor attention.\n\nBeing able to focus is a skill in and of itself, and you can develop that skill.\nWhen you concentrate on something regularly every day (e.g. meditation) you are\nbuilding up your concentration muscles which will help you have laser focus in\nother areas of your life.\n\nThe way you get better at focusing is to force yourself to get distracted less.\n\nDistractions are things like:\n\n * Email\n * Social media & web surfing\n * Most of the internet really (you can define specific kinds of internet use as\n   acceptable if it’s critical to your work)\n * 99% of alerts on your phone\n\nDon’t take breaks from Distraction, take breaks from Focus. Focus should be your\ndefault state of mind. Only allow yourself to be distracted at predefined times.\n\nYou can schedule the occasional break from focus where you can give in to\ndistractions. It has a side benefit of also training yourself to delay\ngratification.\n\nImplementation tips:\n\n 1. If you need that distraction frequently (e.g. you’re expected to be\n    responsive to email) , then schedule shorter, more frequent, “distraction”\n    breaks\n 2. Absolutely no distractions during the distraction free time. You must resist\n    temptation, even when it seems important, this is training your brain\n 3. Schedule distraction time at home as well as work. Your brain should be\n    trained to always be in focus mode, even if the thing you’re focusing on is\n    family.\n 4. Turn off all non-critical notifications on your phone\n 5. Enable Do not Disturb mode on your phone by default, maybe just allowing\n    phone calls to come through. You can check your phone for notifications\n    during your distraction breaks or set it up to automatically disable Do not\n    Disturb mode during your breaks\n\nCut out your Time Wasters\nEliminate activities that don’t help you achieve your goals.\n\nCal called this rule “Quit Social Media” but it’s really about removing your\nbiggest time wasters. The logic also applies to TV, YouTube, web surfing, etc.\n\nSocial media (and your other time wasters) are tools. They have both positive\nand negative effects, though the negative comes much more easily.\n\nThe Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that\ndetermine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a\ntool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweighed its\nnegative impacts\n\nApply the 80/20 Rule to Your Internet Habits. Figure out which 20% of your\nonline time gives you 80% of the value.\n\nTo do this you need to:\n\n 1. Identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and personal\n    life\n 2. For each goal, list the two or three most important activities that help you\n    satisfy the goal.\n\n * The activities should be specific enough to allow you to clearly picture\n   doing them, but general enough to not be tied to a one-time outcome\n\n 1. Consider the network tools you currently use\n\n * For each, ask whether the tool has a substantially positive, substantially\n   negative, or little impact on the above identified activities.\n * Only use tools that are substantially positive\n\nDon’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself! Make deliberate use of your time\noutside work. The internet is like a time machine that fast forwards you through\nhours of your life (like in the movie ‘Click\n[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000389860/]’).\n\nPut more thought into your leisure time. Think ahead how you want to spend you\nfree time later that day or on a future day. You can use that time to focus on\nthings shown to increase happiness\n[https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2016/07/how-to-find-happiness-3/], such as improving\nyour relationships, engaging in structured hobbies, enjoy nature, etc.\n\nRemove Shallow Work as much as Possible\nShallow work consists of noncognitively demanding, logistical style tasks, that\nyou can often perform while distracted (e.g. filling forms, sending emails).\nEssentially it’s any work that’s not deep work.\n\nThese efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to\nreplicate .\n\nShallow work that increasingly dominates the time and attention of knowledge\nworkers is less vital than it often seems in the moment. Replacing shallow work\nwith deep work means you do more work which is actually profitable. (Of course,\nthere is a limit to how much shallow work you can actually cut out)\n\nDeep work is cognitively exhausting. In the beginning, an hour a day is a\nreasonable amount of deep work time. Experts can do up to four hours, but rarely\nmore.\n\nThe rest of the time can be spent in shallow work.\n\nThe following are tactics designed to push you to not waste time on shallow work\n. They’re all designed around getting you to deliberately choose how you’re\nspending your time\n\nTactic #1: Schedule Every Minute of Your Day\nAt the beginning of each workday, divide your day into blocks and write what\nactivity you’ll be doing in each block.\n\nIssues that’ll come up: your estimates were wrong, and other\nobligations/interruptions will come your way unexpectedly\n\nThat’s okay, just remake your schedule the first chance you get. It’s okay if\nyou have to redo your schedule a dozen times a day\n\nThe goal here is to force yourself to be conscious about how you’re spending\nyour time. It’s a way to make you think “what’s the best thing I could be doing\nwith my remaining time?” This question will make you less likely to spend time\non less productive tasks.\n\nTactic: add overflow conditional blocks, blocks where you were doing Activity A\nbefore and you’ll continue doing it if it takes longer than expected, but if you\nfinish A then you’ll do Activity B instead\n\nTactic: include a ‘miscellaneous’ block for handling generic things that need to\nbe done (email, interruptions, etc)\n\nTactic #2: Finish your Work at the Same Time Each Day\nFixed-schedule productivity: have a firm goal of not working past a certain\ntime, then work backwards to find productivity strategies that allow you to\nsatisfy this declaration.\n\n * You drop what can’t be done, and find ways to maximize what you want to do\n   given your limited time budget\n\nTactic: set drastic quotas on the major sources of shallow endeavors while\nprotecting the deep efforts\n\n * Be asymmetric in the culling your activities to make the fixed-schedule\n   productivity work: cut the shallow while preserving the deep\n * Limiting your time forces you to carefully think about your actions, forcing\n   you to be more productive\n\nThis is a meta-habit that’s simple to adopt but broad in impact\n\nGive Yourself Down Time\nAka: Don’t take your work home\n\nYou need to be able to relax your brain when you’re not working, so that it’s\nready to again give a 100% when you start working again. If you don’t have any\nproblems with that, then go ahead and skip this section. If you find yourself\nthinking about work when you’re sitting with your family, then read on.\n\nOne tactic for this: Have a Shutdown Ritual\n\nThe idea is that if you find yourself thinking about things you need to do, you\nneed to come up with a system that you trust to make sure that everything\nimportant will be taken care of. GTD, bullet journaling, BASB are all different\nsystems meant to achieve this goal, and they all revolve around the idea of\ndocumenting your task list in a way that you trust.\n\nAt the end of your workday, have a shutdown procedure so that your brain can\nstop thinking about what you still need to do. This frees your brain up so that\nit can rest and recover in the evening.\n\nThe process should be:\n\nFirst, ensure every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that\nfor each you have confirmed that either\n\n 1. You have a plan you trust for its completion\n 2. It’s captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right\n\nIf you follow a GTD, bullet journaling, or BASB type system, that system should\nbe meeting the above needs. If it doesn’t, it’s a good idea to analyze your\nroutine to see why it falls short and seeing what you can tweak to fix that.\n\nCal adds that when you’re done, have a set phrase you say that indicates\ncompletion (e.g. “Shutdown complete”). I never did this part myself, but I can\nsee how the routine-ness of it could help flick a mental trigger for some folks.\n\nConclusion\nDeep Work can be an incredibly rewarding activity, both personally and\nprofessionally.\n\nIn short, the keys to successfully engaging in deep work are to:\n\n 1. Work on tasks you find Highly Motivating and then motivate yourself some\n    more\n 2. Develop a Structure for how you’ll do deep work. Don’t just sit there\n    waiting for inspiration to strike\n 3. Train yourself to Get Better at Focusing. You can’t do deep work if you\n    constantly get distracted\n 4. Get Rid of your Time Wasters. I’m looking at you, Facebook\n 5. Remove Shallow Work as much as possible. Sometimes that work is important,\n    but often it’s not really\n 6. Save some Down Time to Recover. Deep work is hard, give your brain time to\n    rest\n\nIf you found these tips useful, sign up below to get new articles I write at the\nintersection of self-improvement, psychology, business, and technology.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1473621038790-b778b4750efe?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-07-10T01:12:07.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-10T01:15:13.000Z","published_at":"2020-01-24T02:12:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"In this information era where all mechanical tasks are being automated, in order to be successful you need to be able to do what machines cannot: be creative.

And if\nyou want a custom domain email address, then chances are you’re interested in\nyour professional reputation. Owning your own domain is a good idea even if you\ndon’t plan to start your own sure just yet. I held off on it a couple years and\nthat was enough for a law student to grab zainrizvi.com -_-\n\nI prefer to buy my domains through namecheap.com, though pretty much any company\nwould work. Use whatever you like, but don’t let the decision of which site to\nuse to stop you from buying your domain! (Use namecheap.com if you’re uncertain)\n\nStep 2 - Sign up for a mailgun.com [http://mailgun.com/] account\nEdit: Mailgun now charges for mail forwarding, but at the bottom of this email\nI've listed other services which let you do the same thing for free. Just\nreplace Mailgun with your chosen service.\n\nThis is the secret sauce. We’ll use Mailgun to forward any email sent to your\ndomain straight to your Gmail inbox (umm…you should sign up for Gmail too if you\nhaven’t already)\n\nGo to their site at http://www.mailgun.com and sign up. It’s free (even if they\nwant you to give them your credit card)\n\nStep 3 - Register your domain with Mailgun\nWithin MailGun find the option to add a new domain (it’s in Sending -> Domains\n-> Add New Domain). Chances are they’ll have setup their new user onboarding to\nguide you through that exact process. Follow the instructions on the page to\nsetup your domain.\n\nWhile MailGun does require a credit card before you can add your domain, they\nwon’t charge you anything if you follow the steps in this blog.\n\nAt some point they will ask you to update your domain’s DNS records. It seems\nscary but they walk you through the worst of it.\n\nThen wait for MailGun to confirm that everything is setup correctly (it tends to\ntake less than a hour, but could be longer)\n\nStep 4 - Setup mail forwarding within Mailgun\nWithin MailGun go to the Receiving section\n[https://app.mailgun.com/app/receiving/routes] and click “Create Route”.\n\nSet the “Expression Type” to “match recipient” and then for the recipient enter\nthe exact email address you’d like to have (I’m using example@zainrizvi.io).\nEnsure the checkbox under “forward” is checked, and enter your gmail address\nthere. Let’s pretend my gmail address is youraddress@gmail.com.\n\nOnce you hit save, any emails that get sent to that recipient email address (in\nthis case ‘example@zainrizvi.io’) will get forwarded to your Gmail address.\n\nNow you can receive emails at your custom domain, but if you reply to any email\nthe recipient will see that you’re sending it from your gmail account. We’ll fix\nthat in the next step.\n\nNote: Don’t bother trying to send messages from the same Gmail account that the\nmessage is being forwarded to. Gmail tries to be smart\n[https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/203306560-Why-am-I-not-receiving-an-email-when-sending-via-the-route-with-the-sending-address-as-a-destination-] \n and hides any messages you’re sending to yourself. So if you’re testing it out,\nsend the message from a different email address instead.\n\nStep 5 - Tell Gmail to send messages from your custom address\nGmail has this handy feature called “Send Mail As” which we’ll be taking\nadvantage of here.\n\nIn Gmail, go to Settings -> Accounts and Import -> “Add another email address”\n\nEnter the custom domain email address you created a route for in mailgun and\nclick “Next Step)\n\nThe next screen asks you to input your mailgun SMTP credentials.\n\nYou can get those from mailgun by navigating in Mailgun to Sending -> Domain\nSettings -> SMTP Credentials, and ensuring you’re using the correct domain from\nthe drop down menu at the top\n\nClick the “Reset Password” button to get a new password which you can let Gmail\nuse to log into the SMTP server. You’ll also find the username and SMTP Server\nto use on that page\n\nEnter the relevant information into the gmail window and click “Add Account”.\nGmail will then send your custom domain email address a message asking to\nconfirm that it’s okay with gmail sending emails on it’s behalf. Since you’ve\nalready set up email forwarding, that email will land right in your gmail inbox\n:)\n\nClick the link to confirm and you’ll now be able to send messages using your\ncustom address.\n\nAs a final step, if you want to make this new email address the mail one you\nuse, go back go Gmail -> Settings -> Accounts and Imports -> Send Mail As. Find\nyour new email address in that list and click on the “make default” button.\n\nAll emails you send will now be sent via your custom domain instead!\n\nAnd Enjoy!\nYou’re done! Now you’ve added email to your custom domain at no additional cost,\nand you get to keep using the wonderful Gmail interface.\n\nThe One Caveat…\nThere is one caveat with this setup: In the unlikely event Mailgun ever decides\nto charge for their route forwarding or SMTP server you would suddenly have to\npay to keep this going. However, there are other online services which make a\nsimilar setup possible for free, so you could always move to them.

Instead, I’d rather run the script in a container just once, and\nthen save that container for future notebooks.\n\nThe scripts referenced below are chunks of logic I pulled out from these master\n[https://github.com/ZainRizvi/UseRWithGpus/blob/master/install-r-gpu.sh] scripts\n[https://github.com/ZainRizvi/UseRWithGpus/blob/master/install-r-cpu.sh]. You\ncan read more about what those scripts do in this blog post on using R with GPUs\n[https://zainrizvi.io/blog/using-gpus-with-r-in-jupyter-lab/] . Splitting the\nlogic into multiple scripts made this stuff much easier to debug (what problems\ndid I run into that had to be debugged? I’ll tell you about it in a future\npost).\n\nFROM gcr.io/deeplearning-platform-release/tf2-gpu\nLABEL maintainer=\"Zain Rizvi\"\n\nRUN apt update -y\nRUN mkdir steps\nCOPY steps/* /steps/\nRUN chmod +x /steps/*\n\nRUN /steps/1-Install-generic-dependencies.sh\nRUN /steps/2-register-with-r-repository-ubuntu.sh\nRUN /steps/3-Install-R-and-IRkernel.sh\nRUN /steps/4-Install-common-R-packages.sh -m GPU\nRUN /steps/5-Add-rpy2-support.sh\nRUN /steps/6-Install-keras.sh\n\n\nAnd now we can run docker build . -f dockerfiles\\tensorflow-2-gpu.Dockerfiles \nagain. This time the command will take a long time to complete (because some of\nthose steps are sloooooow).\n\nBut once it completes, we’ll again be given a new image Id similar to the one we\nsaw earlier. Just tag that and push it to your registry the same way we did\nbefore\n\n$ docker tag xxxxxxxxxxxxx zainrizvi/deeplearning-container-tf2-with-r:latest-gpu\n$ docker push zainrizvi/deeplearning-container-tf2-with-r\n\n\nAnd now your image is available to use on your registry\n\nUse your image!\nTo use your newly created image on AI Platform Notebooks:\n\n 1. Go to the notebooks page\n    [https://console.cloud.google.com/ai-platform/notebooks/] -> New Instance ->\n    Customize Instance\n\n 1. Under the environment drop down select “Custom container”\n\nThen in the “Docker container image” box enter the path to the registry you\npushed your image to. Mine is:\nzainrizvi/deeplearning-container-tf2-with-r:latest-gpu\n\nClick create, and in few minutes your notebook will be ready. You can open it up\nand see that TensorFlow is ready to go\n\nAnd there you go, you now have an R notebook that can run Tensorflow on GPUs!\n\nIt wasn’t all Roses and Rainbows\nThe more astute among you may have noticed that while the script I previously\ndemoed [https://zainrizvi.io/blog/using-gpus-with-r-in-jupyter-lab/] was just,\nwell, a single script, the dockerfile above contains six different scripts which\nseem to be the original script split into six parts. The eagle eyed may even\nnotice that some parts of the script have been slightly changed, and that I’m no\nlonger compiling XGboost.\n\nTurns out the Deep Learning VM images and Deep Learning Containers are note\nquiiiiite 100% identical…\n\nKey differences encountered:\n * VM images run on Debian OS while containers run on Ubuntu\n * Container images don’t the CUDA compiler installed, which is (surprise)\n   required to compile GPU binaries. It contains all the binaries required for\n   runtime though. Turns out those were omitted in order to reduce the size of\n   the docker container.\n * [mild] Containers get very confused if you give them a command that starts\n   with “sudo”. Not a big deal since every command in a container runs as ‘sudo’\n   anyways\n\nThis led to a lot of time spent debugging what I had thought was a solved\nproblem. (And did I mention this was my first time using docker containers?).\nWhich led to…\n\nKey productivity hacks discovered:\n * In your dockerfile, split up your mega script into multiple smaller scripts.\n   Docker will ‘cache’ the results of your previous, successful scripts and\n   restart the build from the script that was changed (downside: this adds more\n   layers to your docker image, but there are workarounds)\n * Edit on the go: If you setup docker hub to pull your code from github and\n   build the image, you can make minor 1-minute fixes from your phone directly\n   on github, commit, and go about your day while docker hub starts a new build\n   run (which may take 2-4 hours to complete…Docker hub is slowwwwww. But it’s\n   free, and enables this nice productivity hack)\n\nIf you’d like to hear about the craziness I encountered debugging this image (it\nwas over 7 hours of debugging + waiting for scripts to run), sign up on the form\nbelow to get an email when that article comes out.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511578194003-00c80e42dc9b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-07-10T01:26:58.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-10T01:28:58.000Z","published_at":"2019-12-17T08:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"5f123d248f96fd003930da36","uuid":"600a840c-0c98-4e5c-a4c4-60bd6bd309f6","title":"How to Use GPUs with R in Jupyter Lab","slug":"using-gpus-with-r-in-jupyter-lab","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/2019-11-26-frustration-1-.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":386}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"sudo -- sh -c 'wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZainRizvi/UseRWithGpus/master/install-r-gpu.sh | bash'\\n\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"#!/bin/bash\\n\\n# Install R\\n\\n#required by multiple popular R packages\\napt install -y \\\\\\n    libssl-dev \\\\\\n    libcurl4-openssl-dev \\\\\\n    libxml2 \\\\\\n    libxml2-dev\\n\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"# Install the lastest version of R from the offical repository\\napt install apt-transport-https software-properties-common ocl-icd-opencl-dev -y\\napt install dirmngr --install-recommends -y\\napt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 'E19F5F87128899B192B1A2C2AD5F960A256A04AF'\\n\\nadd-apt-repository \\\"deb http://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian stretch-cran35/\\\"\\n\\napt update\\napt install r-base -y\\n\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/2019-11-27-safe-1-.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"# Install IRkernel\\nRscript -e \\\"install.packages(c('repr', 'IRdisplay', 'IRkernel'), type = 'source', repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')\\\"\\n\\n# Register IRkernel with Jupyter\\nRscript -e \\\"IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)\\\"\\n\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"# Install various R packages\\n\\nfunction install_r_package() {\\n    PACKAGE=\\\"${1}\\\"\\n    echo \\\"installing ${PACKAGE}\\\"\\n    Rscript -e \\\"install.packages(c('${PACKAGE}'))\\\"\\n    # install.packages always returns 0 code, even if install actually failed\\n    echo \\\"validating install of  ${PACKAGE}\\\"\\n    Rscript -e \\\"library('${PACKAGE}')\\\"\\n    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then\\n        echo \\\"R package ${PACKAGE} failed to install.\\\"\\n        exit 1\\n    fi\\n}\\n\\nfunction install_r_packages() {\\n    PACKAGES=(${@})\\n    for PACKAGE in \\\"${PACKAGES[@]}\\\"; do\\n        install_r_package \\\"${PACKAGE}\\\"\\n    done\\n}\\n\\n# Install google specific packages\\nCLOUD_PACKAGES=( \\\\\\n  'cloudml' \\\\\\n  'bigrquery' \\\\\\n  'googleCloudStorageR' \\\\\\n  'googleComputeEngineR' \\\\\\n  'googleAuthR' \\\\\\n  'googleAnalyticsR' \\\\\\n  'keras' \\\\\\n)\\ninstall_r_packages \\\"${CLOUD_PACKAGES[@]}\\\"\\n\\n# Install other packages\\n OTHER_PACKAGES=( \\\\\\n   'tidyverse' \\\\\\n   'httpuv' \\\\\\n   'ggplot2' \\\\\\n   'devtools' \\\\\\n   'gpuR' \\\\\\n   'xgboost' \\\\\\n)\\n\\n install_r_packages \\\"${OTHER_PACKAGES[@]}\\\"\\n\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"# Setup the default location for user-installed packages\\nexport R_LIB_SETUP=\\\"/etc/profile.d/r_user_lib.sh\\\"\\ncat << 'EOF' > \\\"$R_LIB_SETUP\\\"\\nexport R_LIBS_USER=~/.R/library\\n# Ensure this directory exists at startup.

The first time I\ntried, I spent the better half of an afternoon trying to get that done.\n\nAnd once I realized I also had to recompile multiple packages to actually use\nthose GPUs, I was one error message away from being this guy:\n\nThings have gotten a lot better since then.\n\nIn this post I’ll share an easy way to setup your R language Jupyter Notebooks\nto use GPUs. (Though if you prefer to use R outside of a notebook, these steps\nlet you do that too)\n\nIt’s a deep dive into one slide of a talk I gave\n[https://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtcdc/2019/video/dc91511-gpu-powered-computing-for-data-science-with-r-notebooks-on-google-clouds-ai-platform/] \nat Nvidia’s GTC 2019 conference a few weeks ago.\n\nThe Easy Way\nThere are three things you need to get going:\n\n 1. A machine with Nvidia GPU drivers installed\n 2. Install R and Jupyter Lab\n 3. Compile those R packages which require it for use with GPUs\n\nIf you use AI Platform Notebooks\n[https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks/] or Deep Learning VM images\n[https://cloud.google.com/deep-learning-vm/], the Nvidia GPU drivers will be\npre-installed for you (notebooks will give you the easiest experience). You can\nalso find offerings form other companies which also have the drivers\npre-installed, taking care of step 1.\n\nOnce your machine with GPU drivers is ready, SSH into it and run the following\ncommand:\n\nsudo -- sh -c 'wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZainRizvi/UseRWithGpus/master/install-r-gpu.sh | bash'\n\n\nThere, one line and you’re done.\n\nIt downloads a script from my GitHub repository\n[https://github.com/ZainRizvi/UseRWithGpus/blob/master/install-r-gpu.sh] and\nexecutes it on your machine, handling all the tricky parts. That’s it, you can\nnow stop reading this article.\n\nHowever, if you’re anything like me, you may be a liiiiittle bit wary of running\nrandom code from the internet.\n\nLets go deeper into what exactly this script does and make sure it’s safe to\nrun.\n\nWhat’s going on here?\nI’ll walk through the code step by step to explain what it does. You can open\nup\nthe code on GitHub\n[https://github.com/ZainRizvi/UseRWithGpus/blob/master/install-r-gpu.sh] if\nyou’d like to see the full file.\n\n1. Install common packages\nLet’s take it from the top:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Install R\n\n#required by multiple popular R packages\napt install -y \\\n    libssl-dev \\\n    libcurl4-openssl-dev \\\n    libxml2 \\\n    libxml2-dev\n\n\nWe’re installing some packages via apt. These are dependencies for some of the R\npackages we want.\n\nSeem safe enough\n\n2. Installing R\nTurns out installing R is a little complicated. You have to:\n\n 1. Install additional dependencies\n 2. Add a whole new repository to your config\n 3. Tell your computer to trust that new repository\n 4. Then install r, presumably from that new repository\n\nAnd the code for it:\n\n# Install the lastest version of R from the offical repository\napt install apt-transport-https software-properties-common ocl-icd-opencl-dev -y\napt install dirmngr --install-recommends -y\napt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 'E19F5F87128899B192B1A2C2AD5F960A256A04AF'\n\nadd-apt-repository \"deb http://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian stretch-cran35/\"\n\napt update\napt install r-base -y\n\n\nThe steps start to seem a bit iffy here (add a new key? a new repository?), but\nthese are indeed part of the official instructions\n[https://zainrizvi.io/blog/using-gpus-with-r-in-jupyter-lab/]. Feels shady, but\nit really is legit. The official docs and various other tutorials all say the\nsame.\n\n(Still feels like 👇)\n\n3. Integrate with Jupyter Lab/Jupyter Notebooks\nNow we setup Jupyter Lab (or Jupyter Notebooks if you’re using that) to use R.\n\nWe install the IRkernel and register it with Juptyer.\n\nYou can skip this step if you’re not planning to use Jupyter Lab or Jupyter\nNotebooks\n\n# Install IRkernel\nRscript -e \"install.packages(c('repr', 'IRdisplay', 'IRkernel'), type = 'source', repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')\"\n\n# Register IRkernel with Jupyter\nRscript -e \"IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)\"\n\n\n4.

Download the cmake v3.16.0 installer\n 2. Make it executable\n 3. Create a directory for it to install the script to\n 4. Execute the installer\n 5. Clean up afterwards\n 6. Add the new cmake to PATH\n\nAnd then of course we have to compile xgboost itself:\n\n# Install xgboost\ncd\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost\ncd xgboost\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake -DUSE_CUDA=ON -DR_LIB=ON -DR_LIB=ON -DUSE_NCCL=ON -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/cuda-10.1 -DNCCL_ROOT=/usr/local/nccl2 ..\n\nsudo make -j4\nsudo make install\n\n\nThat’s another download build and install.\n\nNote that the cmake command takes a bunch of flags.

This is a form of creating a Minimum Viable\nProduct [https://twitter.com/ZainRzv/status/1060941595879456768]\n\nIn every experiment you must ask: What will I Learn?\n\n * Then work backwards to the simplest experiment which will teach you that.\n   This is the real MVP\n\nNote: experimenting will lead to many failures and disappointments\n\n * Instead of focusing on the failure, focus on the whys behind that failure and\n   what you can learn from it\n * Note what went right\n * Ask “Am I failing differently each time?”\n * Remember, you’re much better off if you fail after a few hours or days of\n   effort instead of after many months of effort!\n * Edison said “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”\n\nLearn to note when you or others are experiencing Cognitive Dissonance\n[https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html], a mental\ndiscomfort when facing conflicting attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors\n\n * This is a sign that you are doing something new\n * This is for getting early feedback on your idea\n\nCollaborative Inquiry\nGet help from others!\n\n * “Do you find this interesting? Want to join me and try to answer it?”\n * To the internet!\n * Not Impossible Labs [https://www.notimpossible.com/] - A site to find others\n\n> “Many more people are drawn to an existing idea they can join in on & help to\nimprove or advance, rather than starting from scratch on their own.”\nYou are inviting collaborators as equals on a project. “Your” question becomes\ntheirs too.\n\nQuestions belong to everyone\n\n> “Share your question in hope of you getting something new: solution,\nperspective, insight, purpose, etc. That thing will be yours”\nQuestioning in Business\n * Why are we in business? And what business are we really in?\n * What if our company didn’t exist?\n * How can we make a better experiment?\n * Should mission statements be mission questions?\n * How might we create a culture of inquiry?\n\nLiving Better by Asking the Right Questions\n * What if we start with what we already have?\n * What if you made one small change?\n * What if you could not fail?\n * How will you find your beautiful question?\n\nWhat is your goal/purpose in life?\n\n * Your mission should fit in one sentence\n * This is a mountain you are climbing. Why are you climbing it?\n\nHow can I develop a sense of community?\n\n * Family\n * Friends\n * Neighbors\n * Block party?\n\nWhat did I love doing as a child? Can I still do any of it?\n\nWhat are you doing when you feel most beautiful/happy?\n\n> “It’s easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than to think your way\ninto a new way of acting”\n * Fake it till you make it\n * [Zain aside: I’m not sure how true this statement is. It seems to apply only\n   to certain types of things]\n\nIf we can’t agree on an answer, can we instead agree on a question?\n\nTeaching to Question\n * Can a school be built on questions?\n * Can we teach ourselves to question?\n * How can we make “being wrong” less threatening?\n\nInteresting Teaching Style: Activity-Permissive Education by Mayo Clinic. Lets\nkids move as they learn\n\nHow can parents teach their kids to question?\n * Ask the kids open ended questions\n * Get the kids to ask you questions (and guide them to certain questions)\n * Don’t answer those questions. Instead explore through experiments or personal\n   experience and have the kid form a hypothesis about the answer\n * When kids come home from school, ask them “Did you ask a good question\n   today?”\n\nQuestion Formulation Training\nThis is a strategy that has been successfully used in classrooms\n\nFirst offer a premise (e.g. “torture can be justified”)\n\nStage 1: Divide people into groups to Brainstorm questions\n\nRules:\n\n * Write each question down\n * Don’t debate or try to answer questions\n * Just keep trying to think of more questions\n\nStage 2: Improve the questions by converting open questions to closed and vice\nversa. For example you’d change between “why is torture effective” <==> “is\ntorture effective”\n\n * This shows that the same question asked differently can make you think in a\n   different space\n\nStage 3: Prioritize. Identify the top 3 questions to move the discussion\nforwards\n\n * It teaches them how to analyze questions and find ones to pursue further\n\nQuestion Teaching Process\n 1. Teachers design a focus for the questions\n 2. Students produce questions\n 3. Students improve their questions (open vs closed)\n 4. Students prioritize their questions (top 3)\n 5. Students and teachers decide on next steps for acting on those questions\n 6. Students reflect on what they’ve learned\n\nImagine: What if the teacher was willing to ask questions that they themselves\ndon’t know the answer to? If the class is interested then…“Lets figure this out\ntogether”\n\nOther thoughts\nHow do you reward questioning in others or in children to encourage this\nbehavior?\n\n * Would the process of discovery will be it’s own reward?\n\nIdeas for a game based on asking questions:\n\n * Learn to ask better questions via proposing and improving questions on a\n   given prompt\n * Example prompt: Given some set of random resources, how can you solve problem\n   X?","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580722434936-3d175913fbdc?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-07-10T01:39:37.000Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T21:07:11.000Z","published_at":"2019-08-09T07:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"5f123d248f96fd003930da3b","uuid":"ff000c7f-f12c-4b90-8967-21c501de5d9a","title":"So Good They Can't Ignore You - Key Ideas","slug":"so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you-key-ideas","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0076DDBJ6/\"]],[\"strong\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"These are my notes from Cal Newport’s book \"],[0,[0],1,\"So Good They Can’t Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I’m going to skip the persuasive arguments that Cal listed and jump straight to the conclusions that resonated with me\"]]],[1,\"h1\",[[0,[],0,\"Value your Autonomy\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"“Find your Passion” is a lie.

At the bottom you'll find more links, including ones with \nword for word scripts on what to say:\n\n16 Principles to Remember during a Negotiation\n1. They need to like you\n * If you get an offer, these people like you and want to keep liking you (but\n   you’re not the only person in their life)\n\n2. They have to believe that you deserve it\n * Don’t ever ask for something without saying why you deserve it\n * Sometimes saying why you deserve it might make them like you less (#1) so be\n   careful\n\n3. They need to be able to justify and act on it internally\n * Need to figure out where they’re flexible and where they are not flexible\n\n4. You need to be flexible about which currency they pay you in\n * You shouldn’t care about salary, bonus, options, city, etc. Should focus on\n   value of entire deal\n * The more ways you give them to pay you, the more likely you are to get paid\n * Including perhaps not rewarding you today, but rewarding you later on\n * They need to believe that they can get you\n * People won’t go fight for you and spend political capital for you if they\n   think you’re going to refuse at the end of the day\n\n5. Avoid the minutia\n * Think about the interests that are really important to you, but not haggle\n   over every little thing (you don’t want to sour the negotiation and make them\n   not like you: see point #1)\n\n6. Try to learn as much as you can at every moment.\n * Need to understand the person across the table from you\n * Learn as much as you can before the negotiation\n * What do they want, need?\n * Talk to folks in the organization, friends interviewing there, etc\n * Anytime someone says something you didn’t expect or is ambiguous, try to\n   figure out what is going on so you know which world you’re in.\n\n7. Negotiate multiple issues simultaneously\n * For example, if there are multiple things you don’t like about the offer,\n   mention all those things at once\n * Don’t be the guy who says: Hey, can you fix this one thing? “ok” Great, can\n   you do this too? “alright” Cool, can you do this too please?\n * When you mention the few things that you need, it’s important to signal to\n   them what’s most important and what’s less important\n * If you don’t they may pick the two things that are easy for them but less\n   important to you. They may think they’re meeting you half way when you’re not\n   really satisfied\n\n8. What is not negotiable today may be negotiable tomorrow\n * Today they may be hiring 20 people just like you and they have a hard time\n   differing between you. But 6 months down the line they might be convinced\n   that you’re different, or they’re in a different phase of employment and they\n   have more flexibility\n * What may not be negotiable on day 1 of the interview process may be\n   negotiable on day 3\n * E.g., if they tell you we can’t delay the deadline date for you to respond to\n   our offer. But as the deadline gets closer, at that point they may be able to\n   change the deadline later on\n * When they say “no” to something, ask them “Can you help me understand why\n   that is hard to do?”\n * “Under what circumstances would you be able to do this?”\n * “Have you ever done something like this for a person”\n\n9. Stay at the table\n * Stay in touch\n * Perhaps things they couldn’t share with you before the offer, they can share\n   with you after the offer. Or after you have the job, or after you’ve worked\n   there for 3 months, etc\n\n10. Sometimes the other side might bring up something that you wish they didn’t\n * Examples:\n * Do you have an alternate job offer?\n * Did your summer internship give you a job offer?\n * Instead of hoping they don’t ask those questions, prepare in advance to\n   answer those toughest questions\n * What could they ask to put you in a defensive position?\n * When they ask you questions you wish they hadn’t asked?\n * Don’t get stuck on what they’re asking you. Try to figure out you why they’re\n   asking you that?\n * What is the intent of the question? Where are they going with this?\n * Step back, ask them “Can you help me understand where you’re going with\n   this?”\n\n11. Avoid/ignore/downplay ultimatums of any kind (in either direction)\n * Don’t make them either\n * If they make one, pretend it was never said\n * It’s possible that at some point they themselves will realize that the\n   position they took will result in no deal, and the last thing you want is for\n   them to feel like they’ve painted themselves into a corner without losing\n   face. The only way to give them a way out is to pretend it wasn’t even said.\n * If it’s a real ultimatum, they’ll let you know (they’ll repeat it multiple\n   times)\n\n12. Companies don’t negotiate, people negotiate\n * Negotiating with your future boss is different from negotiating with HR\n * It’s okay if HR is slightly annoyed with you, your boss being annoyed may be\n   a problem\n * HR is hiring 100s of people, your boss is hiring very few people and may be\n   willing to go fight to get you\n * Don’t let one person in the company ruin your view of the company\n\n13. Don’t be in a mad rush to get offers\n * Sometimes you want the interview process to be a bit slow so that you have\n   time to interview other places\n * You have to think about the portfolio of deals you’re negotiating, try to see\n   if you can have the offers come in closer to each other\n\n14. Tell the truth\n * Deception isn’t worth it\n\n15. Shoot for an 11 out of 10\n * After the negotiation with you, your boss is going to think about how much do\n   they look forward to working with you. You want them to think you’re an\n   11/10, not even a 10/10.\n * Negotiate in a way, openly, honestly, with empathy, with give and take, that\n   afterwards they like you even more than they did before\n\n16.

An easy way to access this is through the Kudu Console\n[https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Kudu-console] at \nhttp://{yoursite}.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole.\n\nThe instructions below will be using the Kudu Console to create the\n_backup.filter file, but you can use your favorite deployment method to put the\nfile there.\n\nWhat to do\nI’ve got a site that contains log files and static images from past years that\nare never going to change.\n\nI already have a full backup of the site which includes the old images. Now I\nwant to backup the site every day, but I don’t want to pay for storing log files\nor the static image files that never change.\n\nThe below steps show how I’d exclude those files from the backup.\n\nIdentify the files and folders you don’t want to backup\nThis is easy. I already know I don’t want to backup any log files, so I want to\nexclude D:\\home\\site\\wwwroot\\Logs.\n\nThere’s another log file folder that all Azure Web Apps have at D:\\home\\LogFiles\n. Let’s exclude that too.\n\nI also don’t want to backup the images from previous years over and over again.\nSo lets add D:\\home\\site\\wwwroot\\Images\\2013 and \nD:\\home\\site\\wwwroot\\Images\\2014 to the list as well.\n\nFinally, let’s not backup the brand.png file in the Images folder either, just\nto show we can blacklist individual files as well. It’s located at \nD:\\home\\site\\wwwroot\\Images\\brand.png\n\nThis gives us the following folders that we don’t want to backup:\n\n * D:\\home\\site\\wwwroot\\Logs\n * D:\\home\\LogFiles\n * D:\\home\\site\\wwwroot\\Images\\2013\n * D:\\home\\site\\wwwroot\\Images\\2014\n * D:\\home\\site\\wwwroot\\Images\\brand.png\n\nCreate the exclusion list\nYou save the blacklist of files and folders that you don’t want to backup in a\nspecial file called _backup.filter. Create the file and place it at \nD:\\home\\site\\wwwroot\\_backup.filter.\n\nList all the files and folders you don’t want to backup in the _backup.filter\nfile. You add the full path relative to D:\\home of the folder or file that you\nwant to exclude from the backup, one path per line.\n\nSo for my site, D:\\home\\site\\wwwroot\\Logs becomes \\site\\wwwroot\\Logs, \nD:\\home\\LogFiles becomes \\LogFiles, so on and so forth, resulting in the\nfollowing contents for my _backup.filter:\n\n\\site\\wwwroot\\Logs\n\\LogFiles\n\\site\\wwwroot\\Images\\2013\n\\site\\wwwroot\\Images\\2014\n\\site\\wwwroot\\Images\\brand.png\n\n\nNote the starting \\ at the beginning of each line. That’s important.\n\nRun a backup\nNow you can run backups the same way you would normally do it. Manually\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-backup/#create-a-manual-backup]\n, automatically\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-backup/#configure-automated-backups]\n, either way is fine.\n\nAny files and folders that fall under the filters listed in the _backup.filter\nwill be excluded from the backup. This means now the log files and the 2013 and\n2014 image files will no longer be backed up.\n\nRestoring your backed up site\nYou restore partial backups of your site the same way you would restore a\nregular backup\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-restore/].\nIt’ll do the right thing.\n\nThe technical details\nWith full (non-partial) backups normally all content on the site is replaced\nwith whatever is in the backup. If a file is on the site but not in the backup\nit gets deleted.\n\nBut when restoring partial backups though any content that is located in one of\nthe blacklisted folders (like D:\\home\\site\\wwwroot\\images\\2014 for my site) will\nbe left as is. And if individual files were black listed then they’ll also be\nleft alone during the restore.\n\nBest Practices\nWhat do you do when disaster strikes and you have to restore your site? Make\nsure you’re prepared beforehand.\n\nYeah, you have partial backups, but take at least one full backup of the site\nfirst so that you have all your site’s contents backed up (this is worst case\nscenario planning). Then when you’re restoring your backups you can first\nrestore the full backup of the site, and then restore the latest partial backup\non top of it.\n\nHere’s why: it lets you use Deployment Slots\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-staged-publishing/] \nto test your restored site. You can even test the restore process without ever\ntouching your production site. And testing your restore process is a Very Good\nThing [http://axcient.com/blog/one-thing-can-derail-disaster-recovery-plan/].\nYou never know when you might run into some subtle gotcha like I did when I\ntried restoring my blog and end up losing half your content.\n\nMy horror story\nMy blog is powered by the Ghost [https://ghost.org/] blogging platform. Like a\nresponsible dev I created a backup of my site and everything was great. Then one\nday I got a message saying that there was a new version of Ghost available and I\ncould upgrade my blog to it. Great!\n\nI created one more backup of my site to backup the latest blog posts, and\nproceeded to upgrade Ghost.\n\nOn my production site.\n\nBad mistake.\n\nSomething went wrong with the upgrade, my home screen just showed a blank\nscreen. “No problem” I thought, “I’ll simply restore the backup I just took.”\n\nI restored the upgrade, saw everything come back…except the blog posts.\n\nWHAT???\n\nTurns out, in the Ghost upgrade notes [http://support.ghost.org/how-to-upgrade/] \nthere’s this warning:\n\nIf you try to backup the data while Ghost is running…the data doesn’t actually\nget backed up.\n\nBummer.\n\nIf I had tried the restore on a test slot first I would have seen this issue and\nnot lost all my posts.\n\nSuch is life. It can happen to the best of us\n[http://blog.codinghorror.com/international-backup-awareness-day/].","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-07-10T02:03:27.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-10T02:05:32.000Z","published_at":"2015-06-05T07:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"5f123d248f96fd003930da42","uuid":"0d2db214-0cc5-4cd8-be97-d44246a003d8","title":"Deploy Statically Generated Sites with Yeoman","slug":"deploy-statically-generated-sites-with-yeoman","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"hr\",{}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://zainrizvi.io/images/2015/10/01-No-permission-to-site.png\",\"alt\":\"img\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://zainrizvi.io/images/2015/10/02-Kudu-console.png\",\"alt\":\"alt\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://zainrizvi.io/images/2015/10/03-Dist-folder-appears.png\",\"alt\":\"alt\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"[config]\\nproject = dist\\n\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://zainrizvi.io/images/2015/10/04-Working-site.png\",\"alt\":\"alt\",\"title\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://yeoman.io/codelab/index.html\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-publish-source-control/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki\"]],[\"code\"],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://github.com/ZainRizvi/YoAngularOnAzureWebApps/commit/3fc3040eb65699295e85c151f339dc30aae6c971#diff-a084b794bc0759e7a6b77810e01874f2\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://github.com/ZainRizvi/YoAngularOnAzureWebApps/commit/9be9a4b503a86678d85e3a4287fa26cce1f175b7\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"There are a lot of awesome static site generators out there.

Writing code was the easiest way to build any cool thing that my brain could imagine.  When I thought about what I’d want to do for the rest of my life I thought that I just wanted to keep coding. </p><p>During the next 11 years I became a Senior Engineer at Microsoft and moved on to work at Google and later Stripe. At these higher levels I still get to build, but I use a very different set of tools to do it. There’s a huge mindset shift needed when you go from junior to senior. Writing code becomes a minor part of the job. </p><p>Ever built a tool no one used? I have. It sucked. At the senior levels most of your time goes into identifying <strong>what </strong>needs to be built and <strong>how </strong>to build it. You have to research what the problem looks like. You talk to others and get everyone to agree on what needs to be done. </p><p>These are your new tools:</p><ul><li>Research the problem</li><li>Design the solution</li><li>Build consensus</li></ul><h2 id=\"research-like-a-detective\">Research like a Detective</h2><p>Fresh out of college you get handed tasks where the right answer is pretty straightforward. There isn’t much disagreement on what to do other than the occasional feedback in code reviews.</p><p>As you get more experienced your problems become more ambiguous. The path looks hazy. There are multiple routes you could take, but each one hides its own dragons. It’s not about coding anymore. Most of your work goes into research, and you can’t google the answer.</p><p>Research can take many forms. It usually involves a combination of reading code, reading documentation, and talking to people. Yes, actual human beings. In fact, that’s where most of the information you’ll need is locked away. Did you ever see Sherlock Holmes using search engines? </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8zyhAq2HSKAYAzysnJfbR_m6ZCBloCL5jbUmlwLEnJnmErsiHzd6gOEPtMpJZIp961AlNxUrdloY4B3cFFpVca5iH7Xb3wJgj0rFG7TLO60IGey4TaOJGZITimTXGv7U9hXqh-Pp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>There often is no single person who knows the answer you need. Five different people might hold five different pieces of the puzzle you’re assembling. And you don’t know who those five people are. And they don’t know which pieces you need.</p><p><em>You </em>have to find them. Find them and ask the right questions to sift through their brains, uncovering the nuggets you need.</p><h6 id=\"sifting-for-nuggets\">Sifting for nuggets</h6><p>At Google Cloud Platform, customers would often contact the Technical Solutions Engineers for help when they ran into issues. Those TSEs dug into the problems and fixed them. </p><p>My manager had an idea: “Wouldn’t it be great if we could use AI to automate that process?” We had no clue how to do it. Didn’t even know if it was possible. Heck, we weren’t even sure what kind of problems customers were asking for help with. But that was the challenge my manager offered.</p><p>I accepted.</p><p>Now any AI solution for this kind of a problem requires lots of data. The AI needs to see many broken environments to understand what they look like. And as I searched around I realized we didn’t have that data, it was all locked away in the brains of those TSEs. You can’t train AI with that. </p><p>I had to find the patterns. Maybe chatting with the TSEs would reveal something...</p><p>Me: “So, what type of problem do you usually face?”</p><p>TSE: “Eh, it’s something different every time”</p><p>Darn it, The AI future was looking bleak. </p><p>Me: “Well, what do you do to solve it?”</p><p>TSE: “It depends. Based on the problem, we’ll query one database or another. Then that’ll point us somewhere else, and we keep digging until we find what’s wrong. Then we fix it.”</p><p>No solid data on what problems they solve. No repeatable way to fix them. I was ready to give up.</p><p>Wait a second.</p><p>“Tell me more about these queries you run?”</p><p>What if I changed the problem? Maybe I didn’t have to fix those customer issues right off the bat. What if I helped TSEs debug the problems faster? I could automatically run the hundreds of queries they might run and suggest “Hey, this one had a suspicious result. Maybe dig a bit deeper there?” That’s a lot of debugging the TSEs could avoid.</p><p>I could even extend this to collect the data needed for an actual an AI system. This had potential! The TSEs were excited. My team was excited. My manager was excited. We began coding.</p><h2 id=\"design-the-art-of-balance\">Design: The Art of Balance</h2><p>With ambiguous problems there is no single right answer anymore. There might not be any answer. What you have is a pain point. It could be your customers’s pains, your team’s pains, or even your own pain. The existence of that pain is the problem. Your job is to remove that pain without introducing even greater pains.</p><p>There’s a funny thing about ambiguous problems: they don’t have a clear right answer. Every solution offers certain benefits and has certain downsides. The more of those you discover, the better you’ll be at balancing the tradeoffs you have to make. Some common trade offs to consider:</p><ul><li>How long will it take to develop the solution?</li><li>What’s the opportunity cost?</li><li>How risky is it? What happens if that thing fails?</li><li>How much work will it be to maintain this going forwards?</li><li>How far will it scale? How far does it need to?</li></ul><p>With these ambiguous problems, sometimes the best answer can be “keep doing the thing we’ve been doing.” That was a tough lesson to learn. </p><h6 id=\"young-and-naive\">Young and Naive</h6><p>When I was a wee lad four years out of college, I had been asked to come up with a way to make our database upgrades less risky. The team would manually review all the planned changes to make sure they were safe, but once in a while a bug would slip though and the sound of pagers going off would fill the room as everyone frantically tried to fix it.</p><p>“Can we build a tool to catch those risky changes?” my manager asked me. Woah, this was a super open ended problem. Sweet! I was determined to not let him down. This required digging deep into database upgrade best practices (I even read a whole <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoringDatabases.html\">book on it</a> cover to cover). I spent the winter holidays toiling away developing a prototype that could do upgrades safely. And it worked! Kinda.</p><p>When I showed my creation to my manager he was worried: “You know what, let’s just stick with doing things the way we do right now.” </p><p>Ouch. </p><p>It was a tough lesson on risk management, but he made the right call.

You're talking\nto a black box that repeats “Sorry, that’s against policy” or “I can’t do that”\n\nBut if you can open up that box the picture changes. The moving pieces become\nvisible. Watch how each one ticks, and you’ll start noticing the systems at\nplay.\n\nLeaders design incentives to be armor plating for the company, protecting its\ninterests. They work well for the most part, but all plating has seams.\n\nThe Dangerous Professional\n[https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1162561822248992768] finds those seams and\nslips between them.  They'll dodge gatekeepers and dance around policies, doing\nwhatever it takes to get the job done.\n\nBypass the Gatekeeper\nCompanies setup divisions with the job of managing all the incoming complaints.\nYou know them as customer service.  Depending on whether you’re that company’s\ncustomer or their product\n[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/doug-rushkoff-hello-etsy], customer service’s\nrole varies from “keep them happy with minimal effort” to “get these people off\nour backs.” They’re the ones companies want you to contact.\n\nWhen customer service isn’t being that helpful, look for someone else to\ncomplain to. Like the CEO.\n\nJeff Bezos is famous for reading all customer emails sent directly to him. When\na complaint lands in his inbox he forwards it to one of his reports with just a\nquestion mark added: ‘?’. Whenever anyone gets this email they drop everything\nand scramble\n[https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/5-years-later-jeff-bezos-just-confirmed-jeff-bezos-question-mark-method-that-scares-heck-out-of-everyone-at-amazon-heres-how-it-works.html] \nto solve that customer’s problem. The customer service department doesn’t have\nthat kind of clout.\n\nI witnessed this at Microsoft. The VP got a complaint and forwarded it down to\nhis direct report.\n\nWhich got forwarded down again. And again. And again. Each level adding one more\nmanager’s weight. Propelling it faster and faster and faster till it smashed\ninto my team’s inbox at critical velocity. All hands on deck!\n\nWhy did  this work? Look at what’s happening behind the scenes. Your message\nwent to someone with just enough time to say \"This might be important, I’ll\ndelegate it to the relevant team.\" And it gets fast tracked through the chain of\ncommand\n\nA funny bit of management psychology comes into play here: If your boss’s boss’s\nboss tells you to “look into this please,” it jumps to top of your priority\nlist. Usually folks don’t bother to ask if it should be prioritized higher or\nlower than the large pile already on their plate.\n\nAchievement unlocked: Teleport to front of line.\n\nDance around the Rules\nMany businesses have departments tasked with nothing but creating rules other\ndepartments must follow. Some of those rules get really weird:\n\n> I’m continuously amazed by how many people have to ask permission to buy a $50\nbook, yet are empowered to call a meeting that costs tens of thousands of\ndollars.\n\n— HydroxyCoreyQuinn (@QuinnyPig) March 8, 2019\n[https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1103868678389420033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nOnce I was going on a business trip to help with a conference. My company had\ninstituted a hotel budget of $250 per day. But this was a BIG conference. Hotel\nprices were jacked up, and only the sketchiest places met that price point.\n\nThe cheaper hotels were 30 minutes away, but then I’d blow the budget for uber\nrides. I asked if I'd have to cancel my conference trip.\n\nManager: “There’s not actually an uber limit”\n\nOh.\n\nI booked that distant hotel and took an uber everyday. Now here’s the kicker:\nthe hotel + uber cost more than what I would have paid if I had gotten a hotel\nwalking distance from the venue. But that’s too complicated for the finance\ndepartment to write formal rules around. Imagine if they prevented people from\ngetting a ride when it was really needed!\n\nThus the current policy was born.\n\nIt gets better. When you see the policy’s red lines drawn out, you can dance\naround them like Danny Ocean’s crew navigating a laser maze. \n\nGood sales reps know this and use it to push deals through. Patrick McKenzie \noffers an example [https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1284404823572410369]:\n\n\"Suppose you are selling a $100k product to a director who has $100k budgeted\nfor it. You do the dance. Purchasing says they need a 10% discount because We're\nBig Enough To Always Demand One.\n\nThree days later you submit the following: $100k invoice, discounted 10%, for 1\nyear of SaaS services. Comes out of software budget. $12k invoice, discounted\n10%, for 1 year commitment to professional services. Comes out of consulting\nbudget.\n\nPurchasing is *extremely* likely to approve this.\"\n\nDid the company hire people who couldn’t do basic math? Of course not.\n\nThey pay people who know where their time will be most valuable. Writing a\npolicy that covers 95% of situations will take them 10 hours and saves the\ncompanies $XX millions of dollars. Writing policies to cover the remaining 5%\nwill take ten times as long and only offer a tiny fraction of the savings. The\ncost/benefit analysis doesn’t work out.\n\nIf you learn what was left in that missing 5% you'll have the advantage.\n\nRemember there is no “company.” All of the company’s decisions are actually\nindividuals acting within their own set of incentives. The “company” is what\nemerges when those individual incentives interact with each other.\n\nYou don’t have to fight the entire company.\n\nThere is no companyHidden incentives exist in your own company too. Is a team\nresisting doing something you’re asking for? Learn why. Find the fulcrum point.\nNew paths will emerge.\n\nFor example, I used to struggle with people not responding to my emails when I\ntried to get their approval on a change I was making. “People are busy,” my\nmanager explained. “Instead say, ‘I’ll be making this change on Thursday unless\nyou object before then.’” \n\nI started doing that.\n\nThe objections were rare. The complaints, non-existent.\n\nWhat Makes Them Tick?\nYou get the best results when you adapt your approach to the person you’re\nfacing\n\nNow replace \"person\" with \"team\" or \"department\"\n\nThe sentence remains true\n\nFiguring out each team's incentives can take some detective work\n[https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer#research-like-a-detective]\n. But once you understand them you’ll learn what makes each group tick. As you\nget better at this you’ll find yourself able to collaborate with others much\nmore effectively and Get Stuff Done.\n\nNow since you reached the end,  you might also enjoy my article Interview\nAdvice\nthat got me offers from Google, Stripe, and Facebook\n[https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares/].

That’s where my dollar would\nstretch the furthest, it was clearly the most logical way to give.\n\nThen fate had me help someone face to face.\n\nIt was the third week of November. My team at work had decided to forgo our\ntraditional morale event and instead make Thanksgiving dinner for the homeless.\nMost people decided to put on an apron and help cook the food, but I thought it\nwould be cool to deliver.\n\nWe loaded the van with 80 pounds of turkey goodness and drove down to Tent City\n3 [http://www.sharewheel.org/Home/tent-cities].\n\nI got out of the van feeling a bit awkward. I’d never done anything like this\nbefore, what do you talk to a homeless person about? Fortunately for me, someone\nhad already contacted Tent City.  A couple folks were waiting for us, ready to\nhelp unload the food.\n\nAs we finished setting up the trays, the dinner call went out. I was expecting a\nlong line of rowdy, hungry people to suddenly appear. Instead, cheerful groups\neased by, cracking jokes as they loaded up their plates. “The pie is awful, want\nme to take it off your hands?” “Thanks for the food guys, you grab a plate too!”\n\nJohn, one of the men who’d helped unload, walked over and started telling me\nabout the camp. It was like nothing I’d imagined. They had weekly elections,\nterm limits included; John was the group’s leader this week. Every big decision\nthe camp made was put to a vote, majority rules. They ran their own security\npatrols around the camp and had zero tolerance for drugs. There were even\nconflict resolution protocols! It was a democracy the Greeks would be proud of,\nliving under blue tarps in an overcrowded parking lot.\n\nEven their living arrangements surprised me. They made agreements with various\nchurches to camp out in their parking lot for three months at a time. Careful\nnot to overstay their welcome, when the three months were up they’d pack their\nbags and move to some other church.\n\nAnd then the bombshell: Five days from now their current stay ended and they’d\nhave to leave. But they still didn’t have a place to go.\n\nIt was a punch to the gut. Hearing it directly from John made it viscerally real\nin a way that no powerpoint on poverty could hope to achieve.\n\nI wanted to help. And not just give money.\n\nBut...that went against reason. Why not spend that time earning more money and\ndonate it, like I’d always done? If $10/hour labor can do what I would do, isn’t\nit better to spend that hour earning $40 and donate that instead? Why did this\nfeel different?\n\nOver the next few years I started noticing the answer surfacing in multiple\nancient cultures, based on millennia of hard won wisdom. From the east to the\nwest, across Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and the Orient, the sages offer the\nsame advice:\n\nBuild your community. Support each other.\n\nLeisure isn’t the Goal\nAncient Japanese wisdom talks about ikigai, the happiness of always being busy.\n\nBusy doing what? Helping others.\n\nWait, what?

I was just telling people about the\nstuff I’d worked on, occasionally pointing younger engineers towards tactics I\nhad seen work well. That didn’t feel like anything original, but folks were\nfinding it useful.\n\nIt got really weird when the more senior engineers started asking me about the\ncode base. These were brilliant people who had often helped me over the years.\nDidn’t they already know everything?\n\nI guess not, but they were still way above my league. It’s not like I knew\nenough to offer them real advice.\n\nBut still...my team seemed to think I was doing well. Would other companies\nthink so too? Was I finally hireable? Only one way to find out: I started \napplying [__GHOST_URL__/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares].\n\nI couldn’t believe the results when multiple job offers came in. And one was\nfrom Google! I couldn’t pass that one up. I made the switch.\n\nDuring orientation, Google spent a lot of time discussing Impostor Syndrome, the\nfeeling of accomplished people belittling their own talents and constantly being\nterrified of being discovered as a fraud. That’s a thing?\n\n“Raise your hand if you have this feeling” Hah, yeah right, and have me be the\nonly one raising my...oh, wow, that’s a lot of hands. Mine joined the crowd.\n\nAs I started working, impostor syndrome came up constantly. It was mentioned at\ncompany meetings, folks made memes admitting to it. It was everywhere.\n\nPeople freely admitted to not knowing stuff. Teammates admitted to not\nunderstanding the code, or having no idea how a tool worked. All the stuff I\ndidn’t know, many others didn’t get either.\n\nSeeing everyone admit their ignorance freed me from my own fear. Suddenly,\nfeeling clueless seemed normal.  It was a psychological quirk, not the truth.\n\nMy self-confidence grew. And gradually, without quite realizing it, something\nmagical happened.\n\nImpostor syndrome became a tool. I discovered the impostor’s advantage.\n\nDid I notice feeling intimidated about asking a question? I started pushing\nmyself to ask that question. Turns out other people had felt afraid as well,\nasking that question helped improve everyone’s understanding.  When I started\nopenly admitting to being unfamiliar with a tool or some code, my teammates felt\nlike less of an impostor themselves. Their confidence went up. And they in turn\nbecame more likely to admit the same, creating a virtuous cycle boosting the\nentire team’s morale.\n\nThe impostor’s advantage was a super power.\n\nAnd it offered new insights.\n\nThat feeling of being an impostor is your subconscious telling you something:\nIt’s saying you’re about to push yourself past your comfort zone and into the\ngrowth zone. Now when an opportunity shows up and impostor syndrome starts\ntwitching in the pit of my stomach, that’s a sign I should jump at it! This led\nme to take on bigger and more ambitious\n[https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/#research-like-a-detective] \nprojects, without worrying about being exposed. Somehow I still delivered\nresults, helped by the various people I was no longer afraid to reach out to.\n\nEvery project still started with the thought, “I have no idea what to do here.”\nBut then I’d remind myself, “no one else does either.” That was a surprising\nlesson about the more senior positions: Their work is so valuable precisely\nbecause no one knows exactly what needs to be done. It’s ambiguous. And it\nrequires people who can still push through the uncertainty and forge a path\nforward.\n\nThey embrace the impostor’s advantage.\n\nLooking back, I realize now that in my early days I'd been evaluating myself\nwith biased glasses.I was comparing myself to people much more senior than me.\nOf course there would be a skill gap. If one person understood something, I\nassumed everyone knew it. That was false. As the “systems grow it’s impossible\nfor one person to keep it all in their head”[1]; each person just knew the areas\nthey had personally worked on.\n\nMy biggest mistake: I didn’t value the soft skills I brought to the table. Fresh\nout of college I had taken a significant load off my manager's plate by being\nthe main point of contact with auditors and other teams. The fact that I was not\nwriting code made me think I wasn’t doing anything useful, when in fact the soft\nskill of being able to work with them was incredibly valuable to the team.\n\nAs I continue working and taking on bigger projects, I suspect impostor syndrome\nwill never completely go away. But now I take that as a good thing. An\nadvantage. It’s a sign that I’m growing and stretching myself past my comfort\nzone.\n\nAnd in thost darkest moments, when self doubt is at its highest, I remind\nmyself:\n\nI haven’t been fired yet.\n\nOne of the ways I keep my impostor syndrome at bay is by interviewing regularly,\ntrying to get at least one job offer every year. \n\nThis behavior led to me getting offers from Stripe and Facebook in addition to\nGoogle and Microsoft. It's not hard, it's just that no one tells you how to\nprepare for interviews the right way. \n\nIn the course Insider Advice on how to Pass FAANG Interviews\n[https://zainrizvi.gumroad.com/l/insider-advice-on-how-you-can-pass-faang-interviews/blog_impostor] \nI share the tactics I used to prepare and get those offers.

She\nwas looking for a covid-friendly job on craigslist, something to cut down on the\nstudent loans she'd have to take out for the year. After searching and\nscrounging, Sana found someone who needed logistical help taking care of their\npets. She applied and was excited to get hired.\n\nFirst, they needed help buying pet food. They had ordered $1,800 worth of pet\nfood (they bought high quality stuff in bulk apparently) but the seller would\nonly accept payments via Zelle. Her employer was a bit old fashioned and didn't\nknow how to use that service, so they offered a different arrangement: “I’ll\nmail you a check for $2,000” they said, “please deposit it in your own bank\naccount, and then use $1,800 of it to Zelle the payment to the sellers. The\nremaining $200 is your fee.”\n\nSana was a bit suspicious, but she deposited the check into her Chase bank\naccount and it cleared a few days later. Chase’s site showed that the money had\nbeen deposited successfully and was available to use, no strings attached. \n\nSeemed like it was legit. So she did the honest thing and Zelle'd the money  to\nthe seller.\n\nHappy with the job well done, her \"employer\" sent her another $2,000 check to\ndeposit and transfer. This person really liked their pets. The same process\nhappened again, and her employer was happy with the job well done.\n\nTwo weeks later, Sana’s debit card stopped working. Confused, she checked her\naccount to see what was wrong. \n\nHer heart sank. \n\nChase showed it as overdrawn.\n\nBy more than three thousand dollars.\n\nThe checks had bounced, two weeks after Chase’s site had indicated they had\n“cleared”. Before this whole thing had started, Sana had $300 in her bank\naccount. Now she had negative $3,300.\n\nShe had just been scammed out of $3,600.\n\nWhat happened?\nTurns out checks can bounce weeks after they're deposited. It can take that long\nfor the bank to verify they’re legitimate.\n\nWhy does it take so long? Here’s a peek behind the scenes:\n\n 1. You deposit your check, and it shows up as pending in your account.\n 2. Your bank sends the check to the check-writer’s bank to request the funds.\n 3. Their bank verifies if the check is legitimate and the account actually\n    contains the funds. At small or international banks this step is often\n    manual and could take weeks.\n 4. Their bank lets your bank know it's legit. That's when the check has\n    \"cleared\".\n\nThe life cycle of a checkI skipped one step though: \n\nIt take can than more than six months for a check to clear, but banks remove\nthat “pending” status just a couple days after it's deposited and allow people\nto spend the money. This might sound a bit iffy, but it's actually a good thing.\nMost checks are legitimate and people might need the money quickly. But that\nassumption breaks down with fraudulent checks.\n\nBy removing the “pending” status before fully verifying the check’s legitimacy,\nChase gave the illusion that the check had already cleared. This is what the\nscammers count on.\n\nToday there is no way for a Chase customer to be sure that a check has fully\ncleared. But unless you have the inside scoop on how banks work, or a finely\nhoned sense of when someone is trying to swindle you, you won’t catch it.\n\nWhen Sana called up Chase, the bank heard her out. But instead of stopping the\nscammers, their only concern was making sure she pays up the remaining $3,000\nthat they claimed she owed them.\n\nEdit: Chase customer support had one clarification to make. I'd originally said\nit might take weeks for the check to clear, but they explained it could actually\ntake more than six months. And you'll have no idea when that magic moment\noccurs.\n\n\nAnd she's not the only one who's been hit by this scam.\nMy friend David Vargas was caught by pretty much the exact same scam\n[https://davidvargas.me/blog/i-got-scammed-out-of-5k/]. He was sent checks which\nincluded his fee and payment that was supposed to be made to someone else. And\nthey only accepted Zelle.\n\nIn fact, similar scams\n[https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/16/zelle-users-are-finding-out-the-hard-way-theres-no-fraud-protection/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnljb21iaW5hdG9yLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEVQ_LYXhqL8UBL2vmnP9kphsW_QtokZbglthvs6MgR-ZvqTSF7pcgQMl05VmPjal00O9pBtatU8paO6pmmAYyt91oRIxVEX7L32zEu7v3WKlKOYDV-RVDEHjYe3Co_ugzyWZPRq3oFD-D2giDL1H-Dvj7jmdSbg6NLoAjBnnyWt] \n have [https://news.cardnotpresent.com/news/zelle-scam-emerging] been\n[https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/11/19/how-to-avoid-zelle-scams-and-fraud/] \ngoing on\n[https://medium.com/@eirurueta/i-was-scammed-by-using-zelle-for-ethereum-crypto-online-2fa3a38d1817] \n for years\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-accidentally-venmoed-149-to-a-stranger-good-luck-getting-it-back-1531411133]\n, yet most banks don’t seem to care as long as they're not the ones losing\nmoney.\n\nWhat should Chase have done here?\n#1 Take responsibility: their system is broken\nIs Chase bank directly responsible for scamming people? Of course not. Did they\ncreate an environment where scammers could thrive? Absolutely.\n\nThe harm was unintentional, but they played a hand in it. \n\nInvoluntary manslaughter.\n\nWhat have other companies done when someone abused their products to\ndeliberately cause harm? They took responsibility for it and fixed the problem\nat a systematic level.\n\nThe Tylenol murders: In 1982, someone started spiking bottles of Tylenol\n[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/tylenol-murders-1982] with poison, killing\nseven people. This was clearly not Tylenol’s fault, but they still immediately\npaid to recalled all bottles in the stores, offered anyone who had already\npurchased the pills free replacements. They took it a step further and developed\ntamper-proof packaging to prevent anyone from contaminating the medicine again\nin the future.\n\nCredit Card fraud services: Online payments are inherently risky. Credit card\ncompanies know this, and they’ve committed to helping their customers when the\ninevitable fraud occurs. If you pay someone with your Discover card and the\nproduct turns out to be a scam, Discover will accept responsibility and refund\nyou the money, taking a loss if necessary. This dynamic keeps Discover on their\ntoes working to prevent scams before they even happen.\n\n#2 How should they fix it?\nMake the status of the deposited check abundantly clear. This is how Chase can\ntamper-proof their bottles.\n\nIf a check has been deposited but not fully cleared, if it hasn't had the actual\nfunds transferred over to the bank, then Chase needs to make that fact clear to\ncustomers! This missing piece of UX is what scammers depend on. That’s the\nsystemic flaw here.\n\nIf the bank actually made the status of the funds clear to its customers, then\nit would have a much stronger leg to stand on when claiming innocence.\n\nBut as things stand right now, the only way a person could know the check was\nstill at risk is if they already knew about the long clearing time and how banks\nhide it. Before the results come back from the external bank, Chase itself\ndoesn’t know if the check is valid. Yet they offer customers no hint of that\nuncertainty.\n\nAnd instead of taking responsibility, what did Chase actually do?\n\nChase took option #3: Shakedown their customers\nChase acted like the mafia, shaking down whoever they could to get their money\nback.\n\nMy sister had created this bank account back when she was in high school. For\nminors, Chase requires a guarantor, someone who would make sure her debts are\npaid.

She's not\nthe most technical person, so google isn't an option. She has to ask for help.\n\nEvery. Single.

One after another, I kept learning the\nfalsehood of yet another \"fact\" that had seemed obviously true. Eventually my\noriginal vision became literally impossible to pull off without making serious\ncompromises (more about that in a future blog post).\n\nHopefully this list will help you avoid the landmines I stepped on. All the\nfalsehoods below are ones I'd considered true at some point in my adult life. \n\nMost of them I believed just one month ago.\n\nMisconception #1: UTC offsets go from -12 to +12\nTurns out, UTC offsets span from -12 to +14. Yeah, +14. That's gives you 27\nhours UTC can be offset by (don't forget the zero offset)\n\nHow does it work? UTC-12 has the same time as UTC+12, but is one day behind.\nSame goes for UTC-11 and UTC+13, etc.\n\nWhy that crazy range? That was a result of pacific islanders decided they wanted\nto be on a specific side of the international date line. \n\nIt makes for a very jagged international date line\n\nMisconception #2: Every UTC offset corresponds to exactly one time zone\nHere are 10 distinct time zones which are all at UTC+5:\n\n * Aqtobe Time\n * Mawson Time\n * Maldives Time\n * Oral Time\n * Pakistan Standard Time\n * French Southern and Antarctic Time\n * Tajikistan Time\n * Turkmenistan Time\n * Uzbekistan Time\n * Yekaterinburg Time\n\nYou might be wondering: if they’re all at the same UTC offset, why couldn’t all\nthose countries just use the same time zone? Perhaps Pakistanis weren’t keen\nabout being on “Yekaterinburg Time”\n\nMisconception #3: There are more countries in the world than time zones\nHow could this one possibly be wrong? Well...\n\n 1. Many countries want their very own time zone (how many do you think run on\n    Myanmar Time?)\n 2. Some countries split themselves up into multiple time zones (e.g. eastern\n    and western times)\n 3. Military time alone uses 25 time zones, one for each hour from UTC-12 to\n    UTC+12\n 4. DST. More on this one below\n\nAll together, there are 244 time zones [https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/] \nused by the 195 countries in the world.\n\nMisconception #4: Every time zone has exactly one agreed upon name\nEver notice how every time zone consists only of English words? Awfully kind of\nSpanish and French speaking countries to graciously use our language, right?\n\nHah, Yeah right. \n\nEastern Standard Time, Tiempo del Este, and Heure Normale de l'Est are all\ndifferent names for the exact same time zone.\n\nHave fun coding that into your library.\n\nMisconception #5: Time zones are always offset from UTC by an integer number of\nhours\nIndia standard time is five and a half hours off of UTC. There are many more\nexamples\n\nMisconception #6: Fine, time zones are always offset from UTC by an integer\nnumber of half-hours\nNepal likes to be at the 45 minute UTC offset.\n\nWhy does that extra 15 minutes matter so much to them? Because they really want\n[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33815153#:~:text=Nepal%20is%205%20hours%20and,a%20mountain%20east%20of%20Kathmandu.&text=It%20gets%20trickier%20in%20the,t%20officially%20have%20time%20zones.] \ntheir mountain to have the sun right above it at noon.\n\nBut it makes you wonder: what would happen if the mountain ever shifted?\n\nMisconception #7: A country stays at the same UTC offset all year long\nDon't forget about Daylight Saving Time! Or as the Europeans call it \"Summer\nTime.\"\n\nCountries practicing DST change their UTC offset twice every year.\n\nMisconception #8: There is a standard format for declaring time zones\nHah, I wish. Here are some standards I discovered, there may be more:\n\nCommon name\nThese are the traditional time zone names we’re used to. Example: Pacific\nStandard Time.\n\nBut I don't know if there's an official term for these names, they just that\nunstandardized.\n\nIANA zone keys\nThis is as close to the official standard as you can get. It's not at all\nofficial, but it's something the developer community has rallied around.\n\nIt's a painstakingly maintained database [https://www.iana.org/time-zones] which\ncontains all known time zone data representing the entire history of local time\nfor places around the globe.  It doesn't give any zone a name though, preferring\nto use the name of the most prominent city in there, which leads to:\n\nProminent city based\nThis one is \"basically bad UI that derives from the IANA zone keys\n[https://twitter.com/pganssle/status/1319794747876253697]\"\n\nFull time zone names come with naming complications, which we discussed above.\nIf that wasn't enough fun, there's also the political implications of\nrecognizing certain time zones such as Israel Standard Time.\n\nSome developers took the safer route and identified time zones only by the name\nof a prominent city in it, not bothering to map it to a common name. That's why\nthe Ubuntu time zone picker makes you select \"New York'' instead of Eastern\nStandard Time.\n\nForget time zones, use the raw UTC offset\nW3's international standard gave up on the notion of time zones and declared\nthat engineers should only store a timestamp's raw UTC offset\n[https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime].\n\nGPS Coordinates\nFun fact: Many APIs for getting a region's UTC offset only want a UTC time and\nlatitude/longitude coordinates. This lets them define any moment unambiguously\nand not have to worry about Daylight Saving Time.\n\nIf you squint your eyes a bit, you could consider this a fourth standard.\n\nMisconception #9: Daylight Saving Time starts at the same time every year\nDid you think this would be the one thing world powers agree on? Each country\nchoose when to start it's own DST\n\nMisconception #10: A country's time zone never changes\nAlmost every year some country will pass a law to edit their time zone.\n\nIn a particularly memorable example, a few years ago the Samoan islands wanted\nto be on the other side of the international date line to get the same weekends\nas their Australian trading partners. So on midnight Dec 29th, they changed\ntheir UTC offset from -11 to +13 UTC, skipping Dec 30th and going straight to\nDec 31st.\n\nSamoan citizens had one less day to celebrate the holidays that year.\n\nOn the plus side, just 40 miles away the American Samoa Islands stayed on the\nother side of the international date line. Now Samoans can celebrate new years\non the Western Island, and then boat over to American Samoa for a second new\nyear’s party the next night.\n\nMisconception #11: A country stays in the same time zone during Daylight Saving\nTime\nFunny thing about DST, it doesn't actually change the time zone's UTC offset.\n Instead, Daylight Saving Time countries switch to a different time zone, with a\ndifferent name.\n\nFor example:\n\nTexas goes from Central Standard Time to Central Daylight Time.\n\nChile goes from Chile Standard Time to Chile Summer Time\n\nMisconception #12: Daylight Saving Time starts around March and ends around\nOctober\nThe Southern hemisphere has their summer in the other half of the year.

Many\npeople don’t know that and keep using the wrong abbreviations during DST months.\nCST might be used for Central Daylight Time.\n\nIf there's no standard name for time zones, can you really expect one for the\nabbreviations?\n\nMisconception #15: There is always an unambiguous conversion from one time zone\nto another\nIf I say I want to convert 5pm Eastern Standard Time to Pakistan Standard Time,\nam I talking about the American or Australian Eastern Standard Time?\n\nAnd is Daylight Saving Time in effect or not?\n\nOkay, it’s tricky. But surely if we include the date and the exact city, then\nwe'd be able to do the conversion reliably, right?\n\nWhat if the date and time are 1:30 am on Nov 1st, 2020, right when US DST ends\nand the clock moves backwards?\n\n1:30am occurs twice that morning, how do you know which instance was intended?\n\nMisconception #16: Your time zone library can recognize any time zone (you are\nusing a library for this, right?)\nRemember all those different potential time zone names and formats? Most\nlibraries will only support one.\n\nAnd they might be limited by the time zones installed on your local machine.\n\nYeah, really.\n\nRemember, if time zones can change based on the whims of a local government,\nthen the library will need some external dataset to base its calculations off\nof. That external dataset just might be the time zones installed on your PC.\n\nMisconception #17: The entire country always shifts during Daylight Saving Time\nIn the US, Arizona doesn't practice Daylight Saving Time\n\nMisconception #18: The entire state always shifts during Daylight Saving Time\nWithin Arizona, the Navajo Nation happily follows Daylight Saving Time\n\nMisconception #19: Other than DST, every city within a state follows the same\ntime zone\nIn Indiana, USA, most cities follow Eastern Standard Time but a few decided to\nfollow Central Standard Time\n\nMisconception #20: Every city sits within exactly one time zone\nA few times in history, state line or time zone lies got drawn without paying\nattention to who actually lived on that border, cutting a city in half.There\nare\na surprisingly large number of examples\n[https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-major-cities-divided-by-two-time-zones].\n\nThis enables some really unusual sleep schedules\n\nIt is also why GPS coordinates are more reliable than city names to determine\nthe time zone\n\nMisconception #21: There’s a designated time zone for every location in the\nworld\nThe north and south poles have no official time zone. Researchers there just\nfollow their own country's time.\n\nThere's no way that could get confusing.\n\nMisconception #22: This is a comprehensive list of misconceptions\nThese are the misconceptions I've uncovered so far, but I'm sure there are many\nmore waiting to be discovered. Heck, I didn't even realize UTC offsets went all\nthe way up to +14 until just 10 hours before I published this list!\n\nMisconception #23: Redditors will agree these are all misconceptions\nWho am I kidding? Reddit never agrees on anything. Seriously though,  this post\nsparked a conversation\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jggx3l/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_time_zones/] \nwhich highlighted a few more misconceptions I'd held. Thanks Reddit! \n\nSome of the highlights:\n\n * #24: Daylight Saving Time starts and stops exactly once each year: When the\n   month of Ramadan starts, some Muslim countries will exit DST time, and then\n   re-enter DST once Ramadan ends.  It makes sunset (the time to end your fast)\n   arrive faster (via matthieum\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jggx3l/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_time_zones/g9wf8o3/?context=3]\n   )\n * #25: DST offsets are always exactly one hour: The Lord Howe island uses a 30\n   minute DST offset (via paulrpg\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jggx3l/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_time_zones/g9qr08v/]\n   ), and England once had a 2 hour DST offset (via bandwidthcrisis\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jggx3l/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_time_zones/g9rsvzq/]\n   )\n * #26: Standard Time is the same as Time Zone: They're different concepts\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jggx3l/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_time_zones/g9ql7cl/] \n   (and apparently I've been using them wrong this whole article :P) (via \n   lpsmith\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jggx3l/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_time_zones/g9ql7cl/]\n   )\n * #27: Timezones are always offset from UTC by an integer number of\n   quarter-hours: Amsterdam was once at the UTC + 19 minute, 32.13 second\n   offset. Most of the world simplified it to UTC+0:20\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B00:20] (via DJDavio\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jggx3l/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_time_zones/g9qwqp6/]\n   )\n * #28: Everyone follows their official time zone: Some western parts of China\n   have their own unofficial time zone (via jl2352\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jggx3l/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_time_zones/g9r1wxz/?context=3]\n   ), and some industries independently decide to ignore DST to mitigate the\n   timezone madness (via bitchkat\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jggx3l/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_time_zones/g9relwp/]\n   )\n * #29: You can solve your problems by saving the time as UTC: Saving future\n   timestamps in UTC can still lead to confusion\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jggx3l/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_time_zones/g9r90ni/?context=3] \n   (via AryA_ch\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jggx3l/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_time_zones/g9r90ni/?context=3]\n   )\n * #30: Birth dates tell you who is older:Not necessarily\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jggx3l/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_time_zones/g9raph0/?context=3] \n   (via oshkarr\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jggx3l/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_time_zones/g9raph0/?context=3]\n   )\n * #31: There are exactly 195 countries in the world: Not exactly time zones but\n   another misconception (via kankyo\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jggx3l/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_time_zones/g9qztxm/?context=3]\n   )\n * #32: If you have a UTC timestamp and the GPS coordinates, you can always\n   determine the local time: Palestine and Israel have different time zones.

Every time I work around a problem, two others appear!\nJust how twisted can time zones be?!?\n\nAnd I thought this project would be easy.\n\nTake a deep breath...Phew. Alright, how do I work around this issue without\ncompromising my vision too much?\n\nThat was me a few weeks ago.\n\nAfter seeing my aunt struggling [__GHOST_URL__/newsletter/newsletter-14/] to\nconvert time zones, I’d taken up the quest to build a site that would make the\ntask easier. I’m always looking for fun side projects to build, and this one\nseemed like an easy candidate.\n\nI was young and naïve. Time zones are never easy\n[__GHOST_URL__/blog/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time-zones/]\n\nHere’s the story of how I designed the web app, the hurdles I faced building it,\nand the principles I used to keep making progress.\n\nSet clear goals\nFirst I had to know what I was aiming at\n[https://twitter.com/ZainRzv/status/1322215554380308480].\n\nI don’t write code for the sake of writing code, there is always some deeper\ngoal. For me, it’s usually about what I expect to learn and capabilities I plan\nto enable. Being clear on the goal is key to cutting scope ruthlessly later on.\nIt lets me see how the plan can be simplified while still offering everything I\nwas after\n\nMy goals for this project:\n\n * Enable others to easily share timezone links\n * Practice rapid project development and reducing scope by building a feature\n   complete service.\n * Build in public\n * Have fun\n\nThat was why I was building. But what was I going to build in particular?\n\nI wrote it down:\n\nI've learned through experience that I tend to only stick with my side projects\nfor two weeks [__GHOST_URL__/blog/do-more-by-doing-less/]. So I had to narrow\ndown the vision to something that fits in that time frame. Anything unlikely to\nfit in that time frame got listed as a stretch goal. I’ll probably never do\nthem, but writing those ideas down helps relax my brain, reassuring it that the\ncool features I just thought of aren’t being ignored (i.e., I’m using the \nZeigarnik effect\n[https://www.psychologistworld.com/memory/zeigarnik-effect-interruptions-memory] \nto my advantage).\n\nI had my what and my why. Now for the how.\n\nFocus on the User\nI can’t make a good product without looking at it from the user’s point of view.\nAnd for this project I had a very specific user in mind: \n\nA person on WhatsApp sending an invitation to their friends to hang out online.\nThey’re not too technically minded, but proficient enough to send a zoom link.\nAnd They don’t want to open up another app or website to create a link. That’s a\npain to do. \n\nThis was the user persona I kept in mind as my target audience. \n\nMy solution: Let them be able to simply type out the link from memory.\n\nDesigning the Interface\nGiven that the url was meant to be typed directly into a chat box, how the url\nwould look would be a big part of the design.\n\nThe idea was that the person writing the invitation would write the timestamp\ninto the url, and when anyone clicks on it the site would show them that time\nconverted into their own local time\n\nThis was going to be the entry point to my app, so it had to be easy to use\n\nYou saw my first idea in the screenshot above. It looked perfect. It was short\nand easy to remember. I was ready to move on to the next step.\n\nExcept...\n\nThat was my first idea. What are the chances that my first idea would be the\nbest one?\n\nAlright, fine. I'd force myself to write down a few more alternatives.\n\nFor a couple minutes I stared at a blinking cursor until I thought of another\nformat.  It took another minute to notice a third possibility.\n\nAnd then something clicked in my brain and the idea floodgates opened. I jotted\ndown each variation that occurred and some thoughts about them:\n\nWe've come a long way from event.at#2009-05-20/4:22pm/PST seeming perfect!\n\nAt this point I realized I actually had three components to plan for: time,\ndate, and time zone.\n\nI could design each of them independently, and mix and match the best options.\nThis gave me a bunch of possible alternatives, and more importantly, highlighted\nthe many ways people might make mistakes while typing the url by hand.\n\nAnalysis completed, the simplest interface I found was:\n\nPeople would definitely make mistakes with it though, so I planned to add\nsupport for all the other date/time formats I’d discovered.

A few days later I would discover \nhttp://mytime.io/, [http://mytime.io/,] which uses the exact same url format.\n\nDesigning: Keep it Simple\nGiven the two week time constraint, I wanted to keep things as simple as\npossible. Part of that would be to minimize the amount of new tech I’d have to\nlearn.\n\nTo keep things simple, I decided to use the tools I already knew best and build\na static site with a C# backend.

The food was delicious. My teammates were fun to\nbe with, we'd even play board games every week.\n\nBut somehow each day just dragged on, and on, and on.\n\nIt wasn't the team\n\nIt wasn't the company\n\nIt was the work.\n\nWas the work important? Yes. Google Cloud Platform couldn't function without\nthis critical piece of infrastructure. Was it challenging? Certainly.\n\nBut was it interesting? Not for me.\n\nI had never chosen to join this team. I was been re-orged into it a few months\nago and this new team's charter was a very different from what I'd signed up\nfor.\n\nThe biggest difference: I was now removed far away from my customers. And I\ncouldn't empathize with them anymore.\n\n\"Things might change\" I told myself, \"I should wait a couple months.\"\n\nA month went by.\n\nTwo months.\n\nSix months.\n\nOccasionally I'd get a chance to do something I found energizing, but those\nmoments were far too rare.\n\nFinally, I had to face the facts. This team wasn't the right fit for me.\n\nI started looking for a different team within Google (they make it really easy),\nand one caught my eye: A brand new team working building tools for Machine\nLearning practitioners. And I'd get to work directly with our customers.\n\nNow that's more like it.\n\nI joined the team and soon we launched AI Platform Notebooks, which became one\nof the the most popular AI services offered by GCP.\n\nBest decision I made all year\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYour nuggets for the week\n\nGoing deeper into motivation and creativity:\n\n 1. Look for work you find energizing\n 2. Notice your own ideas\n 3. Tear down your creativity barriers\n\n#1 Look for work you find energizing\n\"If you’re more focused on advancing than on setting yourself up to do work that\nenergizes you, it’s easy to end up stuck in a role you don’t want\"\n\n-Michelle Bu, Staff Engineer at Stripe (full interview\n[https://click.mlsend.com/link/c/YT0xNTYyMzYxMDE3MzgyNDc1NDcxJmM9YTdtMCZlPTUxODgmYj00NjMwMDk2ODUmZD1wOW42aTlm.UOJxRbaeuX4oS6qgijJmIQP_CkNqVtticluZdR3LCAA]\n)\n\nIf I could change one thing about my time at Google, it would be to figure out\nwhat kind of work I found energizing and go specifically after that.\n\nWe spend most of our lives working. It's a tragedy if we don't enjoy it.\n\nEnjoying work starts a virtuous cycle. We have positive mood, that mood makes us\nmore creative. Which leads to us being more productive. And the high output adds\nto our enjoyment.\n\n#2 Notice your own ideas\nWe're all creative deep inside, but sometimes it feels like we have no ideas. We\ndid it as kids, what changed?\n\nThose ideas are still there, but over time we learned to suppress \"bad\" ideas.\nWe discard them so quickly we don't even remember having those ideas.\n\nTo counter this tendency, I find it helpful to write down an idea as soon as you\nthink of it, no matter how bad it seems. This practice helps develop the habit\nof noticing ideas early on before I forget about them.\n\nI don't have to do anything with the stuff I'm written. Rather, it's an exercise\nto help me notice my own thoughts.\n\nIf you do this, you'll be in good company\n[https://click.mlsend.com/link/c/YT0xNTYyMzYxMDE3MzgyNDc1NDcxJmM9YTdtMCZlPTUxODgmYj00NjMwMDk2ODgmZD16M2E2aTVi.la6CU2CRgOF7FCXYgTNGWP0tfSPTPajV9B3ny9F3ag0]\n\n#3 Exercise: Write 10 ideas every day\nA more deliberate exercise for becoming more creative: Spend 10 minutes each day\ncoming up with ten ideas. It can be on any prompt you choose.\n\nDon't try to have good ideas, put down the first thoughts that enter your head.\n\nAnd if it takes you more than 10 minutes to write ten ideas, then write down\ntwenty ideas instead.\n\nWhy?

Even its dopamine hits triggered the same\nspots that programming would.\n\nTurns out, the best parts of woodworking aren't actually that different from\nsoftware engineering:\n\n1. You build your own tools\nThe best software engineering moments are when you building your own tools.\nThat's work with purpose.\n\nWoodworkers do it too. They call such tools \"jigs\".  Some jigs might be built to\nmeet niche needs (like drilling straight holes\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1tqN65yRaQ]). Others, just to save money.\n\nAs always, you have to decide what's the value of your engineering time.\n\n2. Too many tools\nThere are mind boggling varieties of woodworking tools out there, each optimized\nfor a slightly different situation. Want to saw wood with the grain? Against the\ngrain? Need a quick but ugly cut? Need a smooth cut and don't mind it taking\nlonger? What about curved cuts? And that's just for saws! \n\nEach one is optimized for a specific use case, but unless you have an infinite\nbudget you'll need to decide which ones are actually required for what you want\nto do.\n\nAnyone who's had to choose a storage layer on AWS knows what it's like to\nunderstand your tools, figure out what they're best for, and which one most\nclosely matches your needs.\n\n3. Finite (non-monetary) Budget\nMoney isn't the only thing you budget. \n\nAny limited resource needs to carefully doled out. With software, the budgets\nmight cover hardware constraints (CPU/memory), networking bandwidth, latency\ntargets, engineering man-hours, etc.\n\nTurns out, there's one inflexible budget with woodworking: Physical space!\n\nThere's only so much room in my garage (even after I cleaned it). Whatever tools\nI get have to fit in there along with my work bench. I have to be really picky\nabout what I spend my storage budget on, and some beloved items, like a razor\nsharp table saw, are simply not possible.\n\n4. Design first, build later\nIn both worlds, sketching out your designs before building pays huge dividends.\nYou get a clearer picture of what you'll make and you figure out how the\ndifferent parts will interact.\n\nOtherwise, you might have to throw away days worth of work because you took a\nslightly wrong turn.\n\n5. Waiting\n\nExcept with woodworking, you yell \"The glue's drying!\"\n\nOn the plus side, it lets you work on multiple projects at once.\n\n6. You have Users!\nOnce my wife learned of my plans, the requests for custom pieces started rolling\nin.  Knowing that whatever I build has an eager recipient awaiting it is rocket\nfuel for motivation.\n\nAnd since it's my wife asking for it, it's easier to justify buying the tools I\n\"need\".\n\nOne big difference\nWith woodworking you actually get to hold your creations.\n\nIntrigued?\nWoodworking has the same highs as software engineering (and even more if you\nspend enough time around glue).\n\nYou get the same fast feedback loops, close interaction with your users, while\navoiding some of the more tedious aspects of software engineering. Plus you're\nnever on-call.\n\nI can see why these\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/2mu7i4/how_many_of_you_guys_have_quit_your_day_job_to/cm7pppq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3] \n guys [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24541964] gave up software. \n\nThat's not my path though, programming is too near to my heart and my day job\nlets me do more than just write code\n[https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/].\n\nBut it does help answer a question I've asked myself a lot:\n\nWhat would I do if I was born a hundred years ago, before computers were\ninvented?\n\nAnd the answer is now clear:\n\nFind something to build.\n\nI write anewsletter [__GHOST_URL__/newsletter/] sharing insights on\nhow to leverage lessons from across industries to become a better software\nengineer.

But they found ones which worked with their \npersonalities and their goals.\n\nThey all identified the same core challenge, \"How do I remind future-me of what\npresent-me knows when future-me actually needs to know it?\", and proceed to\nevolve solutions that worked well with their own personal constraints.\n\nWe can do the same.\n\nThe wheel was invented, and now we customize the wheel for every application.\nSimilarly, the popular frameworks are only your starting point.  Adapt it to\nyour own self.  Skip the parts that seem convoluted, that  seem tedious. Just\nadopt the parts that resonate. Maybe that's all you actually need.  It's okay to\nignore the rest.\n\nIt's not about whether you should do PARA or Zettelkasten or any of the other\nmethodologies.\n\nYou shouldn't \"do\" any of them.  Starting from there, and venture forth on your\nown journey.\n\nMy own example\nThe first time I tried PARA, I had to build two PARA systems. One for my work\nnotes and one for my blogging.\n\nEach one went in a completely different direction.\n\nFor work, I had concrete projects I was building towards.  Nearly everything I\ndid went into a Project, and almost everything sent into an Area or Resources\nfolder was never seen again.  I ended up accepting this reality and extended the\nProjects folder structure to meet my own needs, giving each project it's own\noverview section where I'd track the key documents, conversations, tickets, and\neven people.\n\nI've been sticking to this PARA system for two years now, and have been getting\nmore and more value from it with each project and it frequently evolves.  I'll\ngo deeper into how I've implemented this sometime later.\n\nPARA for my personal notes, however, looked completely different.  Over there it\nwas the Projects section which ended up mostly neglected, since I only had\nenough bandwidth to have one significant personal project active at any time,\nand I didn't need much to keep track of that one.  Instead, I focused on\nrecording what I read and categorizing everything into Resources folders.  Soon,\nthose notes started to take on a Zettelkasten-esque vibe, as I started linking\nthem to each other. \n\nBut linking was tedious, and the payoff far from clear.  Over a few months I\nfound myself linking less and less, dropping it completely once I went on an\nunintentional writing hiatus in \n\nWith both these approaches, I let my intrinsic motivation highlight the note\ntaking which gave me the most value and dove deep on it.  The personal\nZettelkasten notes, which always felt like a chore, fell by the wayside (more or\nless) guilt free with lessons learned.  (If I ever pick up Zettelkasten again,\nit'll be after identifying a much smaller slice that I can adopt quickly get\nvalue from)\n\nThe false binary\nBut I'll be sticking with the PARA structure for my work notes for a long time\nto come!  But I'm starting to notice options for merging targeted \nZettelkasten-esqe insights into my notes, but this is still the early days for\nthis modification technique.  I'll have to play around with it a lot more first\n\nAnd that's exactly the point!\n\nIn summary:\n\n * Create your own workflow: There isn't no one right way to do things. There's\n   are only ways that work for for you and ones that don't.\n * Eat the elephant one bite at a time: These aren't all-or-nothing systems.\n    Find a slice of value and incorporate it into your existing habits\n * Rinse and repeat: The system is never 'done'.  You'll always keep tweaking it\n   as your circumstances change and you find new friction points\n\nHappy experimenting","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/01/Note-Taking-Strategies-1-.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-01-23T10:44:27.000Z","updated_at":"2022-01-23T10:57:27.000Z","published_at":"2022-01-23T10:48:23.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"629e8fe2e77053003d7fa5cc","uuid":"557a6a06-7e03-4265-a91e-717b6eb9cd65","title":"Insider's Guide to Passing FAANG Interviews","slug":"insiders-guide-to-passing-faang-interviews","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<a class=\\\"course-sale-button\\\" href=\\\"https://zainrizvi.gumroad.com/l/insider-advice-on-how-you-can-pass-faang-interviews/blog_sales_page\\\">Get the Insider's Guide to Passing FAANG Interviews</a>\\n\\n<style>\\n.course-sale-button {\\n\\tbox-shadow:inset 0px 1px 0px 0px #fff6af;\\n\\tbackground:linear-gradient(to bottom, #ffed64 5%, #ffae00 100%);\\n\\tbackground-color:#ffed64;\\n\\tborder-radius:6px;\\n\\tborder:1px solid #ffaa22;\\n\\tdisplay:inline-block;\\n\\tcursor:pointer;\\n\\tcolor:#333333;\\n\\tfont-family:Arial;\\n\\tfont-size:20px;\\n\\tfont-weight:bold;\\n\\tpadding:14px 24px;\\n\\ttext-decoration:none;\\n\\ttext-shadow:0px 1px 0px #ffee66;\\n}\\n.course-sale-button:hover {\\n\\tbackground:linear-gradient(to bottom, #ffae00 5%, #ffed64 100%);\\n\\tbackground-color:#ffae00;\\n}\\n.course-sale-button:active {\\n\\tposition:relative;\\n\\ttop:1px;\\n}\\n\\n</style>\"}],[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<a class=\\\"course-sale-button\\\" href=\\\"https://zainrizvi.gumroad.com/l/insider-advice-on-how-you-can-pass-faang-interviews/blog_sales_page\\\">Get the Insider's Guide to Passing FAANG Interviews</a>\\n</br>\"}],[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<a class=\\\"course-sale-button\\\" href=\\\"https://zainrizvi.gumroad.com/l/insider-advice-on-how-you-can-pass-faang-interviews/blog_sales_page\\\">Get the Insider's Guide to Passing FAANG Interviews</a>\\n</br>\"}],[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<a class=\\\"course-sale-button\\\" href=\\\"https://zainrizvi.gumroad.com/l/insider-advice-on-how-you-can-pass-faang-interviews/blog_sales_page\\\">Get the Insider's Guide to Passing FAANG Interviews</a>\\n</br>\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"],[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"I've gotten offers from Google, Stripe, Facebook, Microsoft, Patreon, Oracle Cloud, & many more, and spent over 12 years as both the interviewer and interviewee while working at Google, Microsoft, and Stripe\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Over time, I realized one thing:\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"Standard interviewing advice falls woefully short\"]]],[3,\"ul\",[[[0,[],0,\"What good does it do to practice coding problems for weeks if your mind goes blank in an interview room?\"]],[[0,[],0,\"Everyone says to be wary of the recruiters, but what if you weren’t\"]],[[0,[],0,\"How can you show your “best self” if you’re too afraid to let it out?\"]]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Grinding interview questions isn't enough.
